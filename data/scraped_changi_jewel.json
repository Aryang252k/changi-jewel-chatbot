There is one city in the land of kimchi that seamlessly blends the best of both worlds. With its gorgeous beaches, delectable food, and laid-back atmosphere, Busan is the ultimate destination for any traveller.\n\n\nWhile the capital city Seoul tends to be more cosmopolitan, with a mix of modern and traditional Korean culture, Busan's is heavily influenced by its coastal location, with a strong emphasis on seafood in its cuisine.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nForget about a simple day trip here. Whether you are a seasoned overseas explorer or new to this resort town, there is something for everyone in Busan. From thrilling activities to must-see attractions, this dynamic second largest city in Korea has plenty of places to visit that will leave you in awe.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are the top five things to do when you are in Busan!\n\n\n1. Live like a local in the Nampo-dong neighbourhood, the old downtown of Busan\n\n\nEnjoy Busan\u2019s best street delicacies along the bustling BIFF Square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep into the heart of Busan\u2019s cinematic magic at the iconic entrance of BIFF Square.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmerse yourself in the glitz and glamour of Busan\u2019s movie scene at the Busan International Film Festival Square (BIFF Square). Once the hub for introducing new talents and the latest films to Asia, BIFF Square has now evolved into a vibrant cultural complex that boasts a plethora of traditional street food and modern inventions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy a feast of flavours at BIFF Square\u2019s bustling food alleys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet vendors line the square with stalls, welcoming visitors with local snacks and delicacies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare to tantalise your taste buds with a unique-to-Busan street treat, the mouth-watering Ssiat Hotteok. These fried Korean pancakes are filled with a heavenly mix of crunchy seeds, including pine nuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds, adding a delightful texture and a burst of flavour to every bite. A perfect blend of sweet and salty, this Busan-style Hotteok is a must-try snack that will leave you craving for more as you explore the vibrant streets of BIFF Square.\n\n\nBIFF Square \ube44\ud504\uad11\uc7a5\n\nAddress:\n\u00a044, Nampo-gil, Jung-gu, Busan\n\n\nKorean address:\n\u00a0\n\ubd80\uc0b0 \uc911\uad6c \uad6c\ub355\ub85c 44\n\n\nOperating hours:\n\u00a0Open all year round\n\n\nForget the maps and explore the buzzing Gukje Market for unexpected finds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood streets along Arirang Street in the Gukje Market. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for more things to do in Busan? With over 60 years of history, the adjacent Gukje Market is an iconic marketplace that offers a wide range of products and services. As you stroll through the vibrant alleys, you will find yourself seamlessly transitioning from the bustling BIFF Square to the famous Gukje Market Food Street, where locals and tourists alike flock to satisfy their cravings. If you are looking for a specialty, be sure to try the delectable Chungmu Kimbap, a Korean rice roll filled with spicy radish and boiled squid. \nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnlike the traditional markets you might find in Seoul, this open-air food street offers a unique dining experience. Picture yourself seated among the hustle and bustle of the market as you savour the local delicacies. And if you are a bargain hunter at heart, you will love the wide range of products from \nhousehold essentials\n like cookware to fashion products like \nbags\n.\n\n\nPro-tip:\n Get the most of your visit to the Gukje Market by planning your trip over the weekends as most of the food stalls only operate on Saturdays and Sundays. Located along Arirang Street in Gukje Market, most food stalls only accept cash, so don\u2019t forget to bring some cash for your shopping and dining adventures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nArirang Street \uc544\ub9ac\ub791\uac70\ub9ac\n\n\nAddress: \n35 Gwangbok-ro, Jung-gu, Busan\n\n\nKorean address:\n \n\ubd80\uc0b0 \uc911\uad6c \uad11\ubcf5\ub85c35\ubc88\uae38 11\n\n\nOperating hours:\n 09:00 to 20:00 daily.

Stretching from Gukje Market to Yongdusan Park, it is a must-visit attraction spot for any serious shopper.\u00a0\n\n\nFor families, head over to the nearby Lotte Mall or the Shinsegae Centum City instead.

Among Busan\u2019s newest additions is this iconic Haeundae Blue Link Park, a picturesque eco attraction that has breathed new life to the abandoned coastal railway. Hop aboard the colourful sky trains that are taking social media by storm, take a leisure ride on the beach train or stroll along the waterfront. Endless adventures await!\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe view from the capsule that travels from Mipo to Cheongsapo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand travelling on a capsule from Mipo to Cheongsapo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTickets to the four-seater sky capsules sell out fast, especially during sunset and it\u2019s no wonder why. With a 30min-long non-stop, one-way ride on a 10m-high elevated railway, you will be treated to stunning views and picture-perfect moments. The best part is that each of these private cabins can accommodate up to four passengers, so you can share the experience with your loved ones,\u00a0 or enjoy a solo adventure all by yourself at a ticket cost for two pax.\u00a0\n\n\nPro-tip:\n If you are looking to capture the perfect sunset photos on your ride, be sure to book your tickets on the Mipo-Cheongsapo route. This outer route is the most sought-after for its stunning sunset views, as opposed to the Cheongsapo-Mipo route which runs on the inner rail.\u00a0\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to plan ahead too. Tickets go on sale two weeks in advance, so make sure you secure your seats on the website for the best time slot. Foreigners can check out using their email addresses and pay via a foreign credit or debit card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSit back, relax, and enjoy the ocean views as you travel along the coastal track via the on-ground beach train. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to snap a few photos of the gorgeous views while you travel along the coastal track!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe beach train is a hop-on-and-off sightseeing train that operates on-ground along the coastline, offering passengers a comfortable and convenient way to make the most out of their seaside exploration. As opposed to the sky capsules that only operate between two stations, this train stops by all six terminals along the park.\u00a0\n\n\nWith limited seating available, try to snag a prime spot on the train if you can. Even if you do not, there will be seats available as people disembark at each station. For those who prefer to stand, there is plenty of room in the standing area behind the benches too.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRide the beach train or explore coastal beauty on foot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden in the limelight is the walking trail that runs parallel to the beach train. Nestled away from the tourist crowds, this hidden gem provides a more intimate and affordable experience. You will be amazed to find that this trail is a favourite among locals of all ages, from leisure strollers to fitness enthusiasts and furry friends too!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the best of Busan\u2019s scenic coastal charms at these key highlights along the Haeundae Blue Line Park. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have three to four hours, taking all three options will provide you with the most holistic experience of the Haeundae Blue Line Park - ride the sky capsule from Mipo to Cheongsapo, hop on the beach train from Cheongsapo to Songjeong, and then walk back along the beachfront for an unforgettable journey.\u00a0 Along the way, go caf\u00e9 hopping at Gukdekpo station or feast on some of the freshest seafood at Cheongsapo.\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry about getting tired. If your legs give way, you can always catch a ride on the beach train back. Do keep in mind that ticketing kiosks are only available at selected stations (Mipo, Cheongsapo and Songjeong stations). Unmanned ticking machines in English, Chinese, and Japanese languages are available at the other three stops so don\u2019t fret!

If you wish to claim GST Refund on your purchases, you should present your passport to the retailers upon payment. To review or select your purchases for GST Refund, you may wish to visit the e-services portal at \nhttps://touristrefund.sg\n.\n\n\nApplying for GST Refund can be done at GST Refund facilities at the terminal of your departure. For claims on items to be checked-in, GST Refund has to be done before your flight check-in. For claims on hand-carried items, GST Refund has to be done in departure transit after clearing immigration.\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to collect your original receipt or invoice before leaving the shop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich retailers participate in eTRS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs eTRS is a voluntary scheme, not all retailers in Singapore operate the scheme. GST-registered retailers may choose to operate the scheme on their own or engage the services of a Central Refund Agency.\n\n\n\nThere are currently three Central Refund Agencies in Singapore:\n\n\n\nGlobal Blue Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Blue retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Blue' sign in their shops.\n\n\nWebsite: \nhttp://www.globalblue.com/\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Tax Free Pte. Ltd.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Tax Free retailers affiliated with this agency display a 'Global Tax Free' sign in their shops.\n\n\nWebsite: \nhttp://www.global-taxfree.com.sg\n\n\n\n\nRetailers who operate the scheme on their own usually display signs that indicate 'Tax Refund' in their shops. However, it is best that you check with the retailers if they are operating the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How much GST refund can I receive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual amount refunded may be lesser than the GST you have paid as a handling fee for the refund service will be deducted by the retailer, Central Refund Agency or operator of Central Refund Counter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I obtain my GST refund?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for your GST refund to be processed and goods to be inspected, if necessary. You are required to seek endorsement at the Customs Inspection Counter in the terminal where you will be checking-in your goods or where your flight will be departing from. You must also depart with the goods on a flight within 12 hours after obtaining approval of your GST refund.\n\n\nFor check-in items:\n\n\n Prior to checking-in the goods, please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at the Departure Check-in Hall (before Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.\n\n\nFor hand-carried items:\n\n\n Please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.\n\n\nAt the kiosk, you will be asked to:\n\n\n\n\nSelect your preferred language\n\n\nScan your passport\n\n\nDeclare your eligibility and acceptance of the TRS conditions\n\n\nSelect / Deselect the purchases you wish to apply for GST Refund\n\n\nSelect your refund options; Cash, Credit Card or Alipay\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have completed the steps above, you will be shown the status of your refund on the kiosk. If your purchases need to be inspected, please proceed to the Customs Inspection Counter for the physical inspection of the goods. Please present the goods, together with your passport, the original invoice(s) or receipt(s) and your confirmed flight itinerary or boarding pass to the Customs Inspection Counter for endorsement.\n\n\nRefund via Credit Card\n\n\n The approved refund amount will be credited to the specified credit card within 10 calendar days.\n\n\nRefund via Cash\n\n\n Please proceed to the GST Cash Refund Counter in the Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to collect your cash.\n\n\nRefund via Alipay\n\n\n Follow through the instructions at the kiosks or counter to receive your Alipay refund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere do I obtain my GST refund?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GST refund counters are located at both public and transit areas, and are open 24 hours, daily.\n\n\nTerminal 1\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 1 Public, Departure Hall (near Check-in Rows 3 and 4)\n\n\nTerminal 1 Transit (near iShopChangi Collection Centre and Charles & Keith)\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 2\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 2 Public, Departure Hall (near Check-in Row 12)\n\n\nTerminal 2 Transit (near iShopChangi Collection Centre)\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 3\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 3 Public, Departure Hall (between Check-in Rows 5 and 6)\n\n\nTerminal 3 Transit (near iShopChangi Collection Centre and Lotte Duty Free)\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 4\n\n\n\n\nTerminal 4 Public, Departure Hall (between Check-in Rows 3 and 4)\n\n\nTerminal 4 Transit (near iShopChangi Collection Centre and Lotte Duty Free)\n\n\n\n\nGST Refund is also located at Jewel Level 1 (near iShopChangi Collection Centre and Changi Lounge), please note that this service is only available to passengers who use Early Check-in facility at Jewel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further details on GST refund, please click \nhere\n\n\n\n\nTourist Refund Scheme (Singapore Customs)\n\n\nGuide for Visitors on Tourist Refund Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Cash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA traveller who enters or leaves Singapore is required to give a report if he carries with him an amount exceeding S$20,000 (or its equivalent in a foreign currency).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe report shall be handed over to the Immigration Officer at the Customs Red Channel on arrival in Singapore and at the Immigration Counter on departure from Singapore.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe form 'Physical Currency and Bearer Negotiable Instruments Report (Traveller)', which is available in English, Chinese, Malay and Japanese, can be obtained from the Immigration card counter, police post(s) and the airlines.

This Filipino province is home to some of the most gorgeous natural wonders in the world.\u00a0\n\n\nCebu is known for waterfalls, clear beaches, tall mountain peaks and abundant nature experiences. There\u2019s so much to see and do, you\u2019d be shocked that you haven\u2019t made Cebu your getaway destination sooner, especially when there\u2019s a direct flight available from Singapore. Without further ado, here are what we consider the best nature-related things to do in Cebu. \nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n1. Hike to the top of Cebu \u2014 Osmena Peak\n\n\n \nOsmena Peak stands at 1,013 metres above sea level, making it the tallest point in Cebu. From this vantage point, visitors can take in the rough rugged terrain of the Mantalongong mountain range\u2014the sharp lines of limestones cutting through the horizon, backlit by the glitter from the ocean behind. This view makes it no wonder that hiking is one of the absolute must-dos while in Cebu.\u00a0\n\n\nSunrise is particularly magical from the top of the mountain, but don\u2019t take our word for it. This is something you\u2019d have to experience for yourself. Fortunately, it\u2019s only a short 20-30-minute walk from the base to the peak, which means you don\u2019t necessarily have to wake up in the middle of the night just to make it for sunrise.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not confident of your navigation ability (don\u2019t be, there are clearly marked trails!), there are \ntours\n available. Not only do they pick you up from your hotel, but Kawasan Waterfall is also included in the itinerary. That way, you\u2019re enjoying two sights in one trip.\n\n\n2. Swim with thresher sharks \u2014 Malapascua Island\n\n\n \nCebu\u2019s also well known for offering the chance to swim with majestic animals, such as thresher sharks and whale sharks.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the practice surrounding the latter is highly controversial and embroiled with ethical concerns, swimming with the former is considered fine. This is because Pelagic thresher sharks naturally visit the waters surrounding Malapascua Island all year round. Unlike with whale sharks, there are no artificial attraction methods (such as feeding) to lure the sharks closer.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to spot them, with their distinctive long tail fin, but also because of how often they\u2019d jump out of the water, not unlike a dolphin. They\u2019re also most active in the early morning.\n\n\nDepending on the time of the year, you might also get to see other marine animals, such as hammerhead sharks, manta rays, reef sharks or even banded sea snakes.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile most of the dive spots are only open to those with diving certifications, there are some that are suitable for novices\u2014such as Whitetip Alley and Chocolate Osland\u2014and you\u2019ll still get to seek sharks. Just ask your dive centre (there are plenty on the South side of the island) to bring you to these specific dive spots!\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n3. Cliff-dive off waterfalls \u2014 Kabutongan Falls\n\n\n \nIf you are a fan of adventure dungeon-type games, you\u2019ll enjoy an adventure through Kabutongan Falls for sure. It\u2019s one of Cebu\u2019s most hidden gems, and by hidden, we really mean it\u2019s hidden in the furthest section of Malabuyoc\u2019s Barangay Looc\u2019s forest.\u00a0\n\n\nThe main feature of Kabutongan Falls is all its hidden caves behind the waterfall, as well as its multiple cliff jump points\u2014one is around 5 metres tall, while another is roughly 8-9 metres tall. The water\u2019s a shimmery turquoise that looks almost unreal. Soaking in it, surrounded by the sounds of nature all around you, really makes the experience something special.\n\n\nGetting there is half the fun too. The journey there involves hiking, trekking and even canyoneering to make it past the thickets and streams. There\u2019s even a section that requires rope rappelling!\u00a0\n\n\nAccording to past visitors, all that only takes half an hour. If you\u2019re worried about your physical ability or safety though, guides are available on site for hire.\u00a0\n\n\nEntrance fee: PHP100 (S$2.40)\n\n\n4. Scuba dive into a sardine ball \u2014 Moalboal\n\n\n \nWhile Malapascua has thresher sharks, Moalboal has sardines!\u00a0\n\n\nNo one really knows for sure why such a huge school of sardines flock to such warm waters, but they\u2019re here. Every day, they partake in a phenomenon called the sardine run. It\u2019s literally tonnes of fish swimming together and forming a giant ball of fish, we promise it looks a lot cooler than we\u2019re making it sound.\u00a0\n\n\nThanks to the close proximity of the sardine ball to shore, you don\u2019t have to spend extra on renting a boat or a tour just to see them. All you need is a pair of goggles and swim out to view the sardine ball from above.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve got scuba diving gear though, even better. The view of the sardine ball from below is even more impressive, with the way the light filters through the water and glints off the surface of the fish.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIf you\u2019re really lucky, you might even get the chance to swim alongside sea turtles and dolphins too! The best time of the year to go is between November and May, when the weather\u2019s the clearest and the water is the calmest.\n\n\n5. Meet wild animals \u2014 Cebu Safari and Adventure Park\n\n\n \nMaybe you\u2019d like to enjoy nature and wilderness in a more controlled setting, that\u2019s valid too! In that case, head on over to Cebu Safari and Adventure Park.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s located just 30 minutes from Danao city centre, making it a convenient one-day trip, especially for those travelling with kids. This safari is over 170 hectares large and is home to over a thousand animals from 120 different species. Tigers? They\u2019ve got them. Meerkats? They\u2019re there too.\u00a0\n\n\nThere\u2019s even a white lion safari, an African savanna experience and bird shows too! Kids would be particularly delighted to know there\u2019s a petting zoo, with goats, cows and ducks lined up at the ready for some loving.\n\n\nAs for the \u201cadventure\u201d part of their name, the park has no shortage of adventure rides available. ATV rides, zip lines, sky bikes, aerial walks, zip coasters and even more are available. All you\u2019ve got to be is daring enough to get down and dirty.\n\n\nTickets are available for sale \nonline\n, but children and senior citizen discounts are only available onsite.\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: Barangay Corte, Toril, Carmen, 6005 Cebu, Philippines\n\nOpening hours: 8:00am to 5:00pm\n\n\n6. Relax on the beach \u2014 Sumilon Island\n\n\n \nIf you\u2019d like nothing more than to just sit back and relax on the beach, then Sumilon Island is the best place to visit. It\u2019s a small little island just off the coast of Oslob with mad views, and far away from the crowds of Mactan beach.\u00a0\n\n\nThe water is remarkably clear, the sand is pristine white\u2014it\u2019s the most picture-perfect, Instagram-ready beach you\u2019ll find on your Cebu trip.\u00a0\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one resort on this island\u2014Bluewater Resorts\u2014but it offers both fancy resort stays and magical glamping experiences. You won\u2019t find yourself lacking for sure. By virtue of being the only resort on the island, they also provide day trips, snorkelling, fishing, paddling and other activities to keep you entertained.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nOtherwise, just lying on a towel and enjoying the sun, sand and sea is a pretty good way to spend time there. It\u2019s a holiday, after all, and holidays are for resting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are so many nature adventures just waiting for you from across the South China Sea, it almost makes you wish you lived in Cebu instead! That said, if this is your first time in Cebu, we\u2019ve got an \nadditional guide\n to prepare you for the trip. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nTiktok\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right into your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips & Guides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\nEnjoyed this article?

As the bustling heart of the country during the Heian period (794-1185), Kyoto is also widely acknowledged as the cultural capital of Japan and its legacy can still be seen today in traditions such as kado (the art of flower arrangement) and chado (tea ceremony), preserved for both the Japanese and visitors around the world.\n\n\nKyoto is also home to numerous Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens - often easily accessible when walking through its streets. But when considering a Kyoto hotel, people are increasingly looking towards ryokans for a truly Japanese experience.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nBest described as traditional Japanese inns, ryokans are a hallmark Japanese experience because of how they have retained the customary environment, hospitality, and traditional architecture - often passed down and maintained through generations. Some of them even include attached onsen (hot spring) facilities - another highlight in Kyoto.\n\n\nWhile ryokans and onsens in Hakone and Kanazawa are also well-known, picking a Kyoto ryokan or onsen has benefits such as its accessibility to major airports, proximity to world-famous Kyoto attractions, as well as a plethora of options with different price points.\n\n\nSo what should one consider when picking a Kyoto ryokan? Can you go to onsens in Kyoto without staying at a ryokan? What are some of the expected \nJapanese etiquette to keep in mind\n? Read on to find out everything you need to know about Kyoto\u2019s onsens and ryokans. \n\n\nThe difference between ryokans and onsens\n\n\nRyokans had their beginnings in wayfarers - catering to passing travellers on foot, which included samurai and tradesmen moving between Tokyo and Kyoto.\n\n\nThe first ever to appear was \nNishiyama Onsen Keiunkan\n in 705 CE, and amazingly, is still in operation today. It remains as the \noldest ryokan in Japan, and also holds the title as the longest continuously-running hotel in the world\n. This ryokan, along with many that followed, were built on the site of rejuvenating hot springs, which is why the pairing became somewhat synonymous. But while ryokans and onsens are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same.\u00a0\n\n\nThe former is an accommodation, while the latter is a natural hot spring water experience, sometimes in the form of open-air baths. Some ryokans don\u2019t have onsens, and some onsens are dedicated facilities with no overnight options. In fact, because of the therapeutic properties of hot spring water, many choose to visit standalone onsens regularly for its health benefits.\n\n\nA typical onsen is a communal affair, with several large sharing pools, each boasting different natural minerals and temperatures for its purported healing properties. They often come with lockers and changing rooms for both genders, and can sometimes include a restaurant or massage services on premise. Private onsen baths can be found too, but these will usually be attached to a ryokan. Travellers may also have reservations about going to private open-air baths or outdoor onsens, but rest assured that the bath will typically be surrounded by a high wall to prevent nosy onlookers.\n\n\nAnother common point of confusion is mistaking sentos (public baths) for onsens. Though similar in format with their lockers and hot communal public baths, sentos are utilitarian hot baths with no natural minerals in their waters while onsens are more akin to that spa visit. They were built as early facilities for those with homes without private baths, but as time went by, owners started adding herbs, minerals and water jets as upgrades, which made them have their own benefits. Both have their fans, but be aware of which you are going to so you are not disappointed.\n\n\nBut whether you\u2019re looking for a memorable ryokan stay or relaxing onsens in Kyoto, the cultural city is a great place to start.\n\n\nChoosing the right Kyoto ryokan for yourself\n\n\nReady for a ryokan? Then expect the following: Overnight lodging in a private traditional Japanese-style room with tatami mat flooring (mats made of woven straw), futons for sleeping comfortably on the mats, and options of breakfast and yukatas (a light cotton kimono). These are typical of standard ryokans, but do know that there are many styles available as well.\n\n\nSome are family-run like \nFujiya Ryokan\n, with rooms that start from S$50 per pax. They boast standard Japanese innkeeper hospitality, with warm and professional staff that can point you towards the city\u2019s best offerings, as well as the charm of having a resident cat on premise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome ryokans, like Sangen Kyoto, are reimagining the traditional inn as a gathering place for travellers to experience traditional Japanese rituals, meals, and activities. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stay at the Sangen Kyoto ryokan promises you an intimate experience in the heart of Kyoto\u2019s Ninenzaka area, with opportunities to experience everything from sushi to shabu-shabu to ikebana. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers, like \nSangen Kyoto\n, are operated by a younger generation of owners that adds a more casual vibe to their ryokans. \u201cTraditional ryokans, sometimes they have a distance between guest and host,\u201d said Shusui Tanaka, its owner. While he and his staff are passionate about sharing the traditional offerings in Kyoto - the whole reason why Tanaka ventured into hospitality after he graduated from university eight years ago - they want to approach it with less formality, and include crafted experiences that are less intimidating.\n\n\nEssentially, it\u2019s like having local friends bring the quintessential Japanese encounters to your doorstep. \u201cWe can have shabu-shabu (Japanese hotpot) or sushi with a chef in the dining area, or shisha (water pipe) at the rooftop,\u201d he shared. In fact, Tanaka himself is an ikebana (Japanese floral arrangement) instructor, who can arrange for sessions in the premises as well.\u00a0\n\n\nThe four-storey ryokan has only four rooms for up to a total of 12 occupants, so a stay there is both intimate and exclusive. But perhaps best of all is its excellent location. From the rooftop, you can easily spy the iconic Yasaka pagoda. And staying in the Ninenzaka area in central Kyoto means that you\u2019ll have access to its rich mix of shops and cafes the area is best known for - including the famous Starbucks housed in a machiya (merchant home).\n\n\nIn fact, having access to some of the best Kyoto attractions and epic views is common with ryokans in the city. As businesses who have been around a long time, they are often strategic in their location, with access to either central Kyoto, a tranquil setting, or proximity to other choice sites.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nJust be sure of your priorities when looking for that best ryokan in Kyoto, as you won\u2019t likely be able to find them all in one. Do you need a Kyoto ryokan with private onsen baths? Would you require them to arrange for cultural experiences like a tea ceremony workshop or geisha (female artist) performance? Are beautiful Japanese garden views, like the ones in \nYachiyo\n, important? Or is staying somewhere like \nHirashin\n, so you can remain in the city centre, preferred?\n\n\nA Kyoto ryokan experience you can save or splurge on\n\n\nWhen looking for a ryokan as a Kyoto hotel stay, many think that it has to be an expensive affair. However, ryokans can actually cater to a variety of budgets, depending on their location, room types, and offerings.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFujiya, as mentioned, allows one to enjoy the traditional ambience with prices starting at just S$50 per pax per room. Others like \nHOSHINOYA\n and \nAman\n offer the most indulgent escapes with prices from S$1,000 - S$4,000. Oftentimes, this is because of the exclusivity accorded to their guests, along with unique experiences only the resorts provide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stay in the luxurious HOSHINOYA Kyoto ryokan begins before you even reach the inn, with a tranquil chartered boat ride down the Katsura river. Image credit: HOSHINOYA Kyoto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruly indulge in Kyoto\u2019s breathtaking natural scenery at the HOSHINOYA ryokan, with luxury guest rooms having private balconies that overlook one of the city\u2019s rivers. Image credit: HOSHINOYA Kyoto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting HOSHINOYA Kyoto itself is a picturesque journey, with a chartered river boat ride drifting you towards a private pier beside the historical building. The ryokan has an elegant outlook finished with local craftsman touches, and provides guest ryokan like monko - the art of incense appreciation. For Aman, their retreat provides a forested escape, as well guest-only indoor and open-air baths attached to a spa. The onsen baths at Aman also contain mineral hot spring water, nourishing your skin with every soak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurnished with traditional tatami mats and simple decor, staying in a Kyoto ryokan like Hirashin gives you a chance to experience a slower, more relaxed side of Japanese culture. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re planning to enjoy a relaxing day indoors at your ryokan in Kyoto, be sure to check if they offer some yummy afternoon tea or treats at no extra cost to satiate you until your next meal. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo witness the festivities of Gion Matsuri (Gion festival) in 2023, I picked Hirashin for its location as it was just minutes away from the main streets of the parade. The Kyoto hotel was housed in a modern building rather than an actual inn, and offered an affordable no-frills city ryokan experience with traditional rooms starting from S$120 a night. While there wasn\u2019t much of an epic view (there were just neighbouring buildings), I enjoyed the daily sets of afternoon tea and treats brought to the room, as well as returning in the evening to my futon laid out. There was also a sento at the basement for guests to enjoy.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a Kyoto ryokan with private onsen, then consider \nYunohana Resort Suisen \nor \nHanaikada\n. The first offers the luxury of being a secluded resort amidst mountains and forests, while the latter is perfectly situated at Arashiyama - known for its beautiful bamboo groves, riverside shops and forest temples.\n\n\nVisit a Kyoto onsen and soak up the community culture\n\n\nEven if you\u2019re not staying at a Kyoto onsen hotel, a visit to the local onsen is highly recommended to experience a slice of Japanese culture - while feeling rejuvenated after. I visited \nHananoyu\n, but \nSagano Tenzan-no-yu\n is also popular among visitors when looking for central Kyoto onsens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of visiting Kyoto\u2019s most popular attractions, a trip to an onsen like Hananoyu is perfect for rejuvenating and recharging your energy. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve forgotten your bath essentials on your visit to Hananoyu onsen in Kyoto! Essential items including slippers and body lotion, as well as add-on services like massages, can be purchased from their convenient vending machines. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Hananoyu, I exchanged my shoes at a locker near the entrance with the provided slippers.\u00a0 There is a ticketing machine listing all the \nbath and body items\n you can purchase, including admission tickets to massage services, razors to \nbody lotions\n. And don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t read Japanese, the reception provides an English-language flyer that translates the text on the vending machine buttons.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nI paid S$7 for my ticket and another S$4 for a set of towels. I exchanged the ticket at the counter and was given my locker key. I was then directed to the onsen on the second floor, where large curtains indicated the male and female entrances.\n\n\nThe rules of an onsen, whether in the form of indoor or open-air baths, are simple. You strip down and place all your items in the locker (except for the small towel and your locker key), and shower thoroughly with the provided toiletries before getting into the pools. It is important that you do so to keep the natural waters clean. Admittedly, the idea of getting completely naked with strangers can be intimidating for some, but most of those who have been through it found it a liberating experience One small caveat - those with tattoos might face problems entering an onsen. Smaller ones can be covered with bandages but for anything larger than your palm, it is best to check with the onsen beforehand if entry is possible.\n\n\nHananoyu boasted two outdoor soaking (or rotenburo) spots - one a more communal pool and two small open-air urn baths. Inside, there were more indoor baths with varying degrees to choose from. There\u2019s no real order to follow, but it is recommended to start with the lower temperatures before moving to the hotter ones. There are bubble and jet baths for those who wish to soothe tired muscles, and a cold bath for after a sauna or steam room session. If you are using those two indoor bath rooms, be sure to dry off a bit before entering, and bring along the provided towels outside the rooms for sitting on. After the session and before the cold bath, make sure to wash off your perspiration from the lukewarm water in the urn as well. You can use your small towel, but remember - it should never touch the bath waters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you\u2019ve washed up from your bath in Kyoto\u2019s Hananoyu onsen, take your relaxation one step further with a delicious meal at their in-house restaurant, or simply enjoy a moment of peace at their rest area. Image credit: Morgan Awyong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you are thoroughly relaxed, head towards the shower to wash up again before towelling down with your large towel at the lockers. Afterwards, I chose to head down for a meal as Hananoyu had an in-house restaurant attached. The lobby itself also provided a large rest area with recliners, a small shopping area, and massage rooms. The nice hot meal after the soaks was an incredible way to end the day at one of the onsens in Kyoto.\n\n\nKyoto\u2019s attractive mix of natural beauty, heritage sites and traditional experiences makes it a quintessential destination when travelling to Japan.

Everywhere you turn, it seems like there\u2019s something you absolutely have to snap and share. East and West, old and new, glitzy and grimy, chic and cute, the list goes on.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve travelled to Hong Kong before, you\u2019ve probably already filled your feed with more views from The Peak, rickety trams, and delicate dim sum than you\u2019d care to admit. In which case, it\u2019s probably time to move away from the tourist hotspots, and on to the local gems and the lesser-known sights. Here are a few best-kept secrets that some friends in Hong Kong slipped us.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nScore a free flight to Hong Kong from 2 to 8 March 2023:\n Don\u2019t miss out the chance to win an air ticket from Singapore to Hong Kong, plus additional perks, for your next trip. Read on to find out how you can be one of the 12,500 winners!\n\n\nBespoke coffee in vintage teacups at Halfway Coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith their custom-designed espresso machine, Halfway Coffee\u2019s brews taste as good as they look! Image credit: Hong Kong Living\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMismatched chairs, exposed concrete and bricks, and their signature coffee in vintage porcelain Chinese tea cups. There\u2019s something innately charming and quirky about the way Halfway Coffee presents itself. Head up to the dusty antique shops of Upper Lascar Row in Sheung Wan (an attraction in Hong Kong that\u2019s worth a visit in itself), and you\u2019ll find it halfway up one of the side alleys, hence the name. It\u2019s as if they just picked a bunch of stuff from their neighbours and set up shop. The result? A mismatching visual experiment that \u2018grams perfectly. But don\u2019t just snap and go, you must savour their brews. They are serious about their coffee (their espresso machine is custom-designed), and while you can\u2019t go wrong with classics like a Latte or Flat White, why not be a bit adventurous and give their Rose Latte or Black Sugar Latte a try?\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHalfway Coffee\n\n\nAddress\n: 26 Upper Lascar Row, Sheung Wan\n\n\nOpening hours\n: 8:00am to 6:00pm daily\n\n\n\u534a\u8def\u5496\u5561\n\n\n\u4e0a\u74b0\u6469\u7f85\u4e0a\u885726\u865f\u83ef\u51a0\u5927\u5ec8\u5730\u92ea\n\n\nThe \u2018other\u2019 sunset money-shot at Braemar Hill (\u5bf6\u99ac\u5c71)\n\n\n \nIt\u2019s always so satisfying to take an iconic shot with your \nmonopod\n from a whole different angle and get \u201cWhere did you take that from?!?\u201d in the comments section of your social post. So instead of repeating that \u201csunset cityscape\u201d snap from The Peak again, go for an easy hike up Braemar Hill, or at the locals call it, Red Incense Burner Summit (\u7d05\u9999\u7210\u5cf0) in Hong Kong. There are multiple hidden viewpoints with beautiful views along the way, but you\u2019ll have to veer off the main path and onto offshoot trails to find them. As they say, fortune favours the bold!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRed Incense Burner Summit\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\nFrom Admiralty MTR station, take the 24M minibus to Mount Butler Block C & D.\n\n\nEnter \u201cRed Incense Burner Summit\u201d into your map app and follow the trail to the top.\n\n\nTo leave, walk down 2 minutes to St. Joan of Arc Secondary School, and take any of a number of buses and minibuses back to the city area.\n\n\n\n\nAn Art Nouveau cocktail at Dragonfly\n\n\n \nWalk into Dragonfly, and you\u2019ll question whether you\u2019re still in Hong Kong, or have been transported back to early 1900\u2019s New York. Inspired by Art Nouveau artist Louis Comfort Tiffany (of the Tiffany & Co. family), everything you see in this bar has been custom crafted to create a one-of-a-kind experience (and photo op). Finish off your day of exploration by digging into the drinks list, and discover their bartender\u2019s equally eclectic creations. If you want to dive fully into the Art Nouveau theme, their Gilded Age Sazerac (S$22.20) is on point. But if you want something truly original, their Dragon\u2019s Pearls (S$23.90) is cheeky alcoholic bubble milk tea that\u2019s creamy and smooth with just the right notes of jasmine. Add this to your list of bars to visit in Hong Kong when you next travel with your buddies!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDragonfly\n\n\nAddress\n: Shop 10 \u2013 G1, Tai Kwun, 10 Hollywood Road, Central\n\n\nOpening hours\n: 5pm to midnight daily\n\n\nDragonfly\n\n\n\u4e2d\u74b0\u8377\u674e\u6d3b\u905310\u865f\u5927\u992810\u5ea7\u5730\u4e0b\n\n\nGeological and archaeological treasures at Tung Ping Chau (\u6771\u5e73\u6d32)\n\n\n \nGleaming skyscrapers and roaring traffic? Not in this remote corner of Hong Kong. The island of Tung Ping Chau (not to be confused with the better-known and more accessible Peng Chau) isn\u2019t just a getaway from the city, it\u2019s also a photographer\u2019s wonderland. Here, you will uncover unique (and surprisingly photogenic) geological formations, and a number of ghost villages. Hike through these abandoned hamlets that are fast becoming reclaimed by nature and bring out your inner urban decay aficionado.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nA visit to this place requires a bit of planning; ferries only run on weekends and public holidays, with only one returning ferry at 5:15pm (make sure you don\u2019t miss it). The island is also physically closer to mainland China than the rest of Hong Kong, so your phone might switch to a China network. To avoid that, pre-load your map and turn off your mobile network when you get there, and be sure to carry along a \npowerbank\n so you always have enough battery.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTung Ping Chau\n\n\nFrom University MTR Station Exit B, take a taxi to Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier (\u99ac\u6599\u6c34).\n\n\nThe ferry (HKD90 ~ S$15.6 return) only runs on weekends and public holidays, with only one or two trips per day, so make sure to check the schedules\n here\n.\n\n\nRevitalised industrial-chic at The Mills (\u5357\u8c50\u7d17\u5ee0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ever-changing exhibitions at The Mills feature works of local artists with a key focus on textiles. Image credit: The Mills \u5357\u8c50\u7d17\u5ee0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s never really been a reason for a non-resident like yourself to go to the district of Tsuen Wan, until now. Originally a cotton mill in the 1960\u2019s, The Mills is now an arts and culture hub. As you explore its cavernous industrial aesthetic for some grand photo ops, it\u2019s the abundance of little design details waiting to be discovered that will enchant the avid Instagrammer in you.\n\n\nBeyond the six artists\u2019 murals by the entrance and its grand industrial-chic aesthetic, it\u2019s filled with hidden gems celebrating local arts and culture. For those thinking about what to do in Hong Kong that gives them a taste of the city\u2019s finest, a visit to The Mills is a must. One of the coolest is Think Of A Style, a little shop that serves as a platform for local artists to showcase and sell their works.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Mills\n\n\nAddress\n: 45 Pak Tin Par Street, Tsuen Wan (Short walk via covered walkways from Tsuen Wan MTR Station Exit A3 or Tsuen Wan West MTR Station Exit A2)\n\n\nOpening hours\n: 10:00am to 10:00pm daily\n\n\n\u5357\u8c50\u7d17\u5ee0\n\n\n\u8343\u7063\u767d\u7530\u58e9\u885745\u865f\u5357\u8c50\u7d17\u5ee04\u6a13\n\n\nThis is just the start\n\n\nThere are many more charming districts like Choi Hung (\u5f69\u8679) or Sham Shui Po (\u6df1\u6c34\u57d7) for you to explore, scenic trails like the Dragon\u2019s Back to hike, and a constant stream of new caf\u00e9s, bars and shops in Hong Kong that will open your eyes. But most importantly, just explore. You might just\u00a0 find a new gem to add to this list. And if you\u2019re all about travelling off the beaten path, there are plenty of \nhidden spots around the world\n to ignite the wanderlust in you!\u00a0\n\n\nHow to win a free round-trip air ticket to Hong Kong and score perks (Hong Kong Goodies)?\n\n\nThe Hong Kong Tourism Board launched a new \u2018Hello Hong Kong\u2019 campaign on 2 February 2023 to woo tourists back to the island after years of Covid-19 travel restrictions. Half a million free air tickets will be given away to Asian visitors by three airlines - Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express.\u00a0\n\n\nThe tickets will be released in phases:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2023: Southeast Asia countries\n\n\nApril 2023: China\u00a0\n\n\nMay 2023: Northeast Asia and other countries\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIf you are based in Singapore, here\u2019s how you can win one of the 12,500 free round-trip air tickets to Hong Kong, given away by Cathay Pacific from 2 to 8 March 2023.\n\n\nStep 1: [Do this before 2 March 2023]\n Sign up for a Cathay account \nhere\n if you are not a member yet.\u00a0\n\n\nStep 2: [From 2 March 2023, 12:00pm (Singapore time)] \nGo to Cathay Pacific\u2019s \n\u2018World of Winners\u2019 campaign webpage\n, sign in to your Cathay Pacific account, answer three questions correctly and submit.

If you are one of the first 12,500 users who submitted correct answers, you will win a free round-trip air ticket to Hong Kong (excluding airport taxes and surcharges). Winners will be announced on the campaign webpage on 20 March 2023 and will be informed via email.\u00a0\n\n\nThat\u2019s not all.

These rest areas are designed to provide a tranquil space where you can catch a quick nap, relax, or simply enjoy a moment of peace before your next flight.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur rest areas are available 24/7, reflecting our commitment to catering to the needs of travellers at all hours. This round-the-clock availability is particularly beneficial for passengers with layovers during late hours or those arriving from different time zones seeking a place to rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the rest areas equipped with amenities like seating and charging stations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, the rest areas are designed to enhance passenger comfort, featuring ample seating options and charging stations for your electronic devices.

Whether you\u2019re into their food, culture or fashion, there\u2019s something for everyone in the land of the rising sun.\u00a0\n\n\nAs borders open up, many will be flocking to its busiest and most popular city, Tokyo, for a long-awaited taste of its metropolitan wonder. If you\u2019re in the midst of planning your trip, here\u2019s a list of lesser-known spots you can visit in Tokyo.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n1. Jiyugaoka, Tokyo\u2019s Little Europe\n\n\n \nOften referred to as osharena machi by the locals, which translates to \u201ca stylish and sophisticated place,\u201d Jiyugaoka is Tokyo\u2019s little paradise that feels distinctly European.\n\n\nBe transported to the continent without leaving Japan \u2013 you can journey along the stretches of boutique stores, restaurants, cafes and narrow paths that look very much like the iconic streets of Paris, Berlin or Venice.\n\n\nSpeaking of Venice, there\u2019s even a small canal with a gondola should you feel the need to soak in the European vibes.\n\n\nTo step back into the Japanese atmosphere, visit the local 800-year-old Kumano Shrine, famous for hosting the traditional Jiyugaoka International Friendship Mikoshi Festival every September. Or take a stroll down Marie Claire Street and Green Street, which are laden with cherry blossom trees. Visit during the spring season, and you\u2019ll see the trees in full pink bloom.\u00a0\n\n\nBesides the plethora of fashion boutiques, you can also find stores that carry unique designer homeware items.\n\n\nJiyugaoka can be easily accessed from Shibuya and Yokohama. Take the Tokyu Toyoko line from Shibuya to Jiyugaoka; Tokyu Oimachi line from Futako Tamagawa; or the express train from Minato Mirai in Yokohama on the Tokyu Toyoko line express service.\n\n\n\n\nAddress:\n Jiyugaoka, Meguro 152-0035, Tokyo Prefecture.\n\n\n2. Inokashira Park\n\n\n \nAn iconic park that\u2019s over 100 years old, Inokashira Park is beloved among Japanese locals for its tranquil walking trails that offer scenery aplenty.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIf the hustle and bustle of Tokyo can feel overwhelming, this forest from a fairytale book will restore your gentle soul. Perfect for clicks, this is one place to make the most of your \ncamera phone\n.\n\n\nThis lush oasis in the heart of the Kichijoji district is where you can picnic freely among the greenery. You will also find the Ghibli Museum, where many from all around the world visit to check out the works of the Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, which has produced popular animated films like Spirited Away. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a tourist hotspot, so be sure to reserve your tickets in advance on their \nofficial website\n.\n\n\nThe park is truly a sight to behold, especially during cherry blossom season (late March to mid-April, or even early May) that bloom near the shore of the Inokashira Pond.\n\n\nStarting at \u00a5600 (S$7.69), you can rent a rowboat or swan boat and paddle around the cherry blossom trees. You can find the park conveniently right next to Inokashira-koen Station.\n\n\n\n\nAddress: \n1 Chome-18-31 Gotenyama, Musashino, Tokyo 180-0005\n\n\n3. Shimokitazawa\n\n\n \nTo truly experience peak Japanese quirkiness, one has to visit Harajuku. More specifically, Takeshita Street.\u00a0\n\n\nWacky, youth-driven and insanely kawaii, Takeshita street is the place to be for all things hip.\u00a0\n\n\nSince we promised something a little more off-beat and less travelled, check out Shimokitazawa, or Shimokita, a bohemian cultural quarter where the vibes of old Tokyo linger.\n\n\nLocated on the west side of Shibuya, Shimokitazawa Station is just seven minutes from Shinjuku Station via the Odakyu line. If you\u2019re into thrifting and love to indulge in a more hipster vibe, Shimokitazawa\u2019s narrow, crisscrossing alleyways are filled with vintage shops, cafes, restaurants,\u00a0 music venues, independent cinemas and theatres.\n\n\nNot so much into shopping? Stop by the traditional temples and shrines. Visit the 400-year-old Shinganji Temple and the 500-year-old Kitazawa Hachiman Shrine, or visit a few parks for a touch of nature.\n\n\nRoka Koshun-en Gardens, Soshigaya Park, Setagaya Park, and Hanegi Park, are all in the vicinity for some extra touch of spirituality.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Kitazawa, Setagaya City, Tokyo 155-0031, Japan\n\n\n4. Tokyo\u2019s Farmers Market (United Nations University)\n\n\n \nJapan does not play around when it comes to the quality of produce, and Tokyo\u2019s Farmers Market (found outside United Nations University) lets you get up close and personal with local farmers so you can see what the hype is truly about.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nUNU Headquarters in Tokyo is located on Aoyama Dori, five minutes from Omotesando station (Exit B2) or 10 minutes from Shibuya station. Fresh produce, herbs, spices, oils\u2014you\u2019ll find it all at this market, giving you a chance to experience an authentic Japanese farmers' market.\n\n\nShopping for groceries got you feeling peckish? Not to worry, as there are food trucks selling street food and beer.\u00a0\n\n\nFor more quirky finds, they sometimes have antiques or used stuff sold in the area, so be sure to peruse! Note that you\u2019ll be supporting local farmers and paying for fresh quality, so expect the goods to be on the pricier side. Trust us, they\u2019re worth it.\n\n\nDuring summer, the warmth gives way to cooler evenings\u2014and that\u2019s when Tokyo Night Market emerges. The evening vibes are livelier, with vintage fashion vendors, jewellery sellers, dinner-centric food and cheap pints of beer flowing.\u00a0\n\n\nA visit to the Tokyo Night Market and Farmers Market are indeed some of the best things to do here in Shibuya if you\u2019re looking for a truly local experience.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 5 Chome-53-70 Jingumae, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0001\n\n\nOpening hours:\n\nSaturday & Sunday: 10:00am \u2013 4:00pm\n\n\n5. Nippara Limestone Cave\n\n\n \nFancy something really off-beat away from sunlight? Visit a limestone cave in the middle of nowhere! A three-hour trip away from Shinjuku, the Nippara Limestone Cave is open to the public. There is a bus connecting it with Okutama Station a few times a day, for those travelling by train.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of escaping the heat, the temperature inside the cave is a steady 11 degrees celsius, a welcome retreat during the country\u2019s relentless summers. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still worth a visit when you travel to Japan \u2013 at a monolithic 1270m in height \u2013 it\u2019s the largest cave in the Kanto region.\n\n\nInside, you\u2019ll find rock formations that are hundreds of years old \u2013 icicles and stalagmites of various jagged and smooth shapes. The cave trail is wonderfully illuminated by lights and ambient music, so you wouldn\u2019t need to be an expert cave explorer to traverse its grounds.\n\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll have to be adequately prepared and dressed for the occasion. Pick your favourite pair of shoes that\u2019s tailor-made for hiking challenging terrain, as the cave grounds are notoriously wet and slippery. There are also plenty of stairs to climb, so be sure to get sufficient rest (and pack enough water!) before your trip over there. A handy travel \nbackpack \nto keep your essentials will do the trick!\n\n\nFollow their \nFacebook\n page for updates \u2013 while the caves are generally open all year, they will be closed depending on extreme weather (like a heavy downpour or a challenging snow day).\n\n\nAdmission costs \u00a5800 (S$80) for adults, \u00a5600 (S$6) for teenagers, and \u00a5500 (S$5) for kids.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 1052 Nippara, Okutama, Nishitama District, Tokyo, Tokyo 198-0211, Japan\n\n\nOpening hours: \nDaily 9:00am\u20135:00pm\n\n\n6. Yanaka (Old Town Tokyo)\n\n\n \nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Ginza, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Harijuku. But what about one of Tokyo\u2019s most traditional neighbourhoods? Yanaka takes you back in time and is one of Tokyo\u2019s best-kept secrets.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nOne of the few districts in Tokyo where the shitamachi atmosphere, an old town ambience reminiscent of Tokyo from past decades, lives on.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find a smorgasbord of Japanese food, lovely artisan workshops, and galleries, amidst elegant temples and shrines.\u00a0\n\n\nBe sure to make a stop to the Nezu Shrine, which dates from 1705 and is a beautiful piece of Edo-era architecture.\u00a0\n\n\nTo visit this rustic town, alight at the JR Nippori Station (west exit) or Chiyoda Line's Sendagi Station (east exit).\n\n\n\n\nAddress:\n 3-ch\u014dme-13-1 Yanaka, Taito City, Tokyo 110-0001, Japan\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVisiting Tokyo this year? We\u2019re so jealous! This guide will bring you on a fun-filled adventure of food, culture and shopping. Even with a guide, nothing beats discovering a hidden nook unexpectedly, so we hope this helps you discover more interesting finds along the way! Plus, you can visit some \ninteresting Japanese stores for a dose of quirkiness\n when you least expect it.\n\n\nHeaded to the Pokemon Centre in Shibuya City, making that memorable walk across the Shibuya Crossing, or adding the above to your Japan travel bucket list? Plan your itinerary alongside all the scrumptious food and drinks you can find in restaurants as well as sushi and sake bars, and rest assured, your trip down to the Land of the Rising Sun will be worth every dollar. \nExperience Japan like a local\n, and you\u2019ll leave with memories like no other!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTiktok\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Travel Information\nTravelling to Tokyo, Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight in the comfort of your own home.

The vibrant and cultural capital of the Netherlands has many unique qualities: bike- and pedestrian-friendly roads, diverse culinary fare (read: lots of fries and bitterballen), countless art galleries and attractions. It is also the second most densely-populated country in the whole of Europe!\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nHaving said that, the Netherlands is a beautiful country with a lot more that can be explored. Here, we bring you to eight hidden gems of this low-lying kingdom.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. Rotterdam \u2013 The second-largest city in the Netherlands\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRotterdam, the second-largest in the Netherlands after Amsterdam, is full of wonder and excitement. It is just less than an hour\u2019s train ride from the capital, Amsterdam. It\u2019s home to the largest port in the world, the Europort, where cargo ships aplenty pass through to the other side of the world.\u00a0\n\n\nStep onto its shores and you\u2019ll quickly learn why it\u2019s one of the most architecturally fascinating places in the country and, really, the whole of Europe.\n\n\nTo understand its vast maritime history, a must-visit is its Maritime District \u2013 populated with large historic boats restored to their former glory and humble houseboats that are still occupied by locals.\n\n\nThe Maritime Museum Rotterdam provides a look into the city and how the sea has been a crucial part of its infrastructure. You\u2019ll get to see paintings, centuries-old vessels, and, of course, plenty of ships.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotterdam\u2019s iconic Cube Houses - one of the city\u2019s most popular things to see. Image credit: Ivan Tan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBut what\u2019s striking about the city is its unique architecture \u2013 often unconventional and certainly different from your usual skyscraper. For a small fee, curious visitors can explore the city\u2019s iconic Cube Houses, a residential development with homes tilted at 45 degrees.\n\n\nNear the museum is the Grote of Sint-Laurenskerk, or the Church of Saint Laurence.\n\n\nIt was originally built in 1449 and has since been a landmark in the city. Its interior sports beautifully decorated arches which lead to high vault ceilings. A glorious and inspired sight once you walk past its doors.\n\n\nWith its museums, shopping, restaurants and nightlife, Rotterdam is happening and there is much to see and do.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nAnother popular place to visit in Rotterdam is the Markthal - a state-of-the-art building which houses an indoor food market with plenty of diverse food choices under one roof, and a residential and office building. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. The Hague \u2013 The capital with the best window into the country\u2019s past\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe historic royalty of the Netherlands is not something often talked about, but it dates back to centuries of influential rulers and warriors. At the Hague, you feel like you\u2019ve travelled back in time.\n\n\nThe time needed to travel from Amsterdam to The Hague is largely the same as Rotterdam. If you\u2019re feeling for a nice drive, it\u2019ll only take you an hour to arrive.\n\n\nA perfect example of the city\u2019s mediaeval allure is the Ridderzaal, or the Knights\u2019 Hall, first built sometime in the 1200s.\n\n\nThe meticulously-restored gothic building usually plays host to state receptions and parliament sessions, but it\u2019s also open to visitors. It\u2019s big, very big. It measures 40m by 20m, with a regal exterior that feels larger than life when you stand in its courtyard.\n\n\nIn the city centre, do spend time enjoying the serene view of the Hofvijver (Court Pond), a lake with a perfect backdrop of the city skyline.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if you are not a fan of museums, you must visit the world renowned museum, the Mauritshuis. It has an amazing collection of Dutch and Flemish art, including Johannes Vermeer\u2019s \u2018Girl With A Pearl Earring\u2019.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe collection of work by M.C. Escher is housed in Escher in Het Paleis, a former Royal Palace. Image credit: Ivan Tan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nBut if you want to experience different perspectives instead of merely awed, the Het Paleis houses a collection of work by legendary artist M.C. Escher, an artist famous for his diverse set of illusory images. This will be the best place to take in his legacy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Court of Justice, established in 1946. Image credit: International Court of Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Hague is also home to many international institutions of law and arbitration, including the International Court of Justice \u2013 it has an interesting visitor centre that offers a free audio guide tour.\u00a0\n\n\nIn the warmer months, the Scheveningen beach, with cafes galore, attracts hordes of surfers, carnival fans and those who just want to enjoy the sun.\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. Eindhoven \u2013 The Dutch city where industrial design meets nature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSlightly south of Amsterdam \u2013 a train ride will take up to two hours \u2013 Eindhoven has a history of its own.\u00a0\n\n\nOriginally a settlement with a wooden castle dating back to the 13th century, it has now blossomed into a city with duality: an eye for cutting-edge architecture while honouring the elements of its humble past.\n\n\nThe Eindhoven Museum is where you get to learn about the city during the middle ages, with faithful recreations of old buildings and villages, along with immersive re-enactments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nTo contrast the mediaeval expedition, you can take a gander at the spaceship-shaped Evoluon building - a science museum built by the electronics company Philips in 1966, but later on converted into a conference centre in 1998. It looks straight out of a UFO movie from the 1980s.\n\n\nIf you want to step into a specific area steeped in history, you can travel to the town of Nuenen, which is 10km away and was the main hideout for a reclusive artist Vincent Van Gogh during his life.\n\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t visit Eindhoven without paying tribute to its most recognizable export \u2013 the electronics brand Philips. Learn about its beginnings, not just of the company but its long range of electronics, at the Philips Museum.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place for a drink or two, head over to Eindhoven Bottle Distillery for some freshly-brewed beer and spirits made by a small and dedicated team of specialists. They\u2019ll be happy to give you a tour of their brewery, and learn the secrets behind their processes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4. Kinderdijk \u2013 The windmill town\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Netherlands without her windmills? Such picturesque and quaint structures that provide much and demand little.\n\n\nWindmills can be found aplenty in the city of Kinderdijk. This UNESCO World Heritage site has 19 windmills lined along a dyke \u2013 a long embankment \u2013 that looks stunning from afar. Built around 1740, the windmills are a part of a larger water management system to prevent flooding. Together with its canals, the windmills and pumping stations of Kinderdijk have kept the area dry and refreshing for over 700 years.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindmills lined along a dyke in Kinderdijk. Image credit: Ivan Tan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you wish to have a closer look at the windmills and learn more about the history behind them, you can hop on a \nboat tour\n which will bring you to two windmill museums (Museum Mill Nederwaard and Museum Mill Blokweer).\u00a0\n\n\nKinderdjik is in general easily explored on foot or bicycle, so you can have long stretches of leisurely travel while admiring the city\u2019s surroundings.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a little trickier to get to Kinderdjik from Amsterdam. It\u2019s recommended to make a trip to Rotterdam first, after which you can sail on to Kinderdjik (via the country\u2019s unique ship, the Waterbus). The trip will only take 30 minutes, and costs EUR10.50 (S$15) for a return-trip ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5. Lisse \u2013 The town that blooms in spring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIf we\u2019re talking less-visited places in the Netherlands that have an undeniable reputation of their own, it would include Lisse.\n\n\nNestled between the cities of Haarlem and The Hague, Lisse has one main attraction that will appeal to everyone: its flower fields.\n\n\nIt hosts the Keukenhof, arguably the world\u2019s most well-known flower park. While winter weather may seem the most tempting for a visit, Keukenhof rewards you greatly when you visit in springtime.\n\n\nDuring this season, endless rows of flowers and tulips will bloom for two months, making an amazing sight that only nature can offer.\n\n\nLisse is also known for its unique export of flower bulbs, which has allowed people all over the world to witness a blooming flower in the comfort of their home garden.\n\n\nThese flower bulbs are also paraded in an annual ceremony that passes through Lisse, starting in Noordwijk and ending in Haarlem \u2013 if you fancy a dedicated road trip.\n\n\nVisiting various tulips gardens will make one hungry. With the town\u2019s seaside charm comes Chique En Simpel, which offers a mouth-watering menu of seafood delicacies that are locally sourced.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6. Utrecht \u2013 The city that\u2019s proudly car-free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSo far in our list, various Dutch cities have boasted a beautiful mixture of its royal past and bustling present.\n\n\nIn the city of Utrecht, it takes away one of the most important inventions of our lifetime: the car. Getting there is also the easiest \u2013 it only takes a half-hour train ride to arrive from Amsterdam.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestaurants and cycling paths alongside the beautiful canals in Utrecht. Image credit: Ivan Tan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIts streets are entirely car-free as it boasts itself as a cyclist-first city, making it one of the largest car-free residential districts in the world. The beautiful canals give a different charm compared to anywhere else in the Netherlands, perfect if you are looking for some much-needed exercise. The tree-lined walkways make for a very pleasant walk or run.\n\n\nBecause it\u2019s so homely, Utrecht may not have awe-inspiring buildings to gawk at, but it does not lack in attractions and unique offerings.\n\n\nThe Sonnenbergh Museum & Observatory looks to the stars to illuminate its surroundings.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can use one of their industry-standard telescopes at night to view stars as a group \u2013 its oldest being 150 years old. Evening events are a regular feature on their calendar.\n\n\nIf you\u2019d rather not be out of this world, go back down \u2013 way below into the underground museum of DOMunder, which tells the 2000-year history of the city.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIt also leads up to the DOM Cathedral and DOM Tower, so you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve completely scaled its heights from top to bottom.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7. Giethoorn \u2013 The village out of a fairy tale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about how the Netherlands has that old-timey magic beyond its capital. Travel 90 minutes north-east of Amsterdam and you\u2019ll find its most picturesque destination that will appeal to both children and adults who\u2019ve held on to any measure of whimsy.\n\n\nGiethoorn is something straight out of a Dutch fairy tale \u2013 full of peaceful lakes, stunning forests, wide-open farms and wooden bridges. You\u2019d almost want to dress for the occasion!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews of Giethoorn as you travel through the canals via a rowing boat. Image credit: Ivan Tan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s also known as the Dutch Venice, but Giethoorn\u2019s modest land size and population makes it feel like a village that\u2019s yet to be discovered by anyone else. A highlight for any visitor is to hire a rowing boat to explore its canals.\n\n\nThere is also a good network of walking paths. This makes exploring the town on foot very easy!\n\n\nYou will need to wear comfortable shoes \u2013 getting there from Amsterdam requires a two-hour train ride to Steenwijk. From there, you can take a 30-minute bus ride, so plan your route accordingly.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8. Otterlo \u2013 The village with greenery and culture aplenty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nOtterlo is the perfect place to spend a few hours, or even a day, if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the cities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIts crown jewel, the Hoge Veluwe National Park, is nature as pure as it can get in these modern times. Originally built as a hunting park in the early part of the 20th century, Hoge Veluwe is now a mega park. If you\u2019ve had enough tall buildings to gawk at, here\u2019s the place for you to wind down and soak in everything that nature has to give.\u00a0\n\n\nExploration in the park can be done by car or on bicycles, the latter which are completely free to rent and use.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kroller-Muller Museum has the second-largest Van Gogh collection in the world. Image credit: Ivan Tan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHoge Veluwe National Park is also home to the highly regarded Kroller-Muller Museum, with its large and stunning collection of Van Gogh\u2019s work. Aside from paintings, you\u2019ll get to see drawings, sculptures, and much more. Best part? Free entry!\n\n\nThe fastest way to get to Otterlo is, surprisingly, by car, only requiring an hour\u2019s long drive. If you don\u2019t have a driver, or you\u2019d rather save money, take the long route by opting for a two-hour train ride. At least there will be plenty of scenery to admire along the way!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFlying to the Netherlands has been easy to do from Singapore, with direct flights operated by Singapore Airlines and KLM. However, in order to visit these amazing cities, you will first need to land in Amsterdam, where you can get the most out of its world-class experience before digging into what the country truly has to offer.\n\n\nAs its locals do not usually practise a lunch culture, it\u2019s normal to find restaurants empty, or closed, in the afternoon. This is a good time to buy fresh groceries and try your hand at whipping something up!\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cVeel plezier!\u201d, which means \u201cHave fun!\u201d in Dutch.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTiktok\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Travel Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight in the comfort of your own home.

At the heart of Cambodian meals is rice, served with an array of dishes that feature fresh herbs, aromatic spices, and a harmonious balance of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter tastes. Fish and seafood, sourced from the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, are central to many dishes, with prahok, a fermented fish paste, adding a unique depth of flavor. The cuisine showcases a diverse range of noodle dishes, curries, and stews, often incorporating coconut milk for richness. Cambodian dishes are very similar to Thai cuisine, but contain much less chilli and sugar, and more aromatic spices.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the popular dishes in Cambodia which might just become your next favourite dish. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBreakfast\n\n\n1. Bai Sach Chrouk (pork and rice)\n\n\n \nKnown for its simplicity and flavour, Bai Sach Chrouk (pork and rice) is a popular breakfast dish in Cambodia, particularly in Phnom Penh.\n\n\nIt consists of pork that has been marinated in palm sugar and fish sauce, then grilled slowly over warm coals, giving it a distinctive smoky and sweet taste. The grilled pork is then thinly sliced and served over white rice.\u00a0\n\n\nAccompanying the dish are pickled cucumbers and radish with ginger, adding a refreshing and tangy contrast to the savoury pork. A bowl of chicken broth, garnished with scallions and fried onions, is often served alongside to complete the meal.\n\n\nThis breakfast staple is commonly found at street corners and is appreciated for its balanced, hearty, and flavourful characteristics, making it a must-try for anyone looking to explore the authentic culinary scene of Phnom Penh.\n\n\n2. Kuyteav (Noodles with soup)\n\n\n \nKuyteav, with its harmonious mix of herbs and meats submerged in a soul-warming broth, is a beloved and iconic breakfast choice in Phnom Penh.\n\n\nOriginating from the Teochew Chinese, Kuyteav is a noodle soup made of rice noodles immersed in a clear, flavourful pork stock, adorned with an array of toppings. Its distinctiveness lies in the blend of savoury and slightly sweet undertones, creating a comforting and flavourful morning meal.\u00a0\n\n\nKuyteav can be enjoyed \u201cwet\u201d, with all ingredients immersed in the soup, or \u201cdry\u201d, where the soup is served on the side, akin to a noodle salad. The latter allows diners to dictate the flavour intensity, adding a personalised touch to the dining experience.\n\n\n3. Num Banhchok (Khmer noodles)\n\n\n \nPrefer a heavier breakfast? Nom Banhchok is your go-to Cambodian food then, with its lightly fermented rice noodles that are both satisfying and flavourful.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nNum Banhchok is celebrated for its variety. Different regions across Cambodia, you will find distinct versions of this beloved dish, each reflecting the local palate and available ingredients.\u00a0\n\n\nFor instance, Num Banhchok Samlor Proher is a classic variation featuring the signature rice noodles served in a flavourful broth, while Num Banhchok Kampot originates from Kampot and is known for its use of peanuts, dried shrimp, and the renowned Kampot fish sauce.\n\n\nThe popularity of Num Banhchok isn\u2019t just restricted to its taste but is also woven into the cultural fabric of Cambodia through folklore.\u00a0\n\n\nA popular Khmer folk legend narrates the story of Thon Chey, a revolutionary and scholar who made a living by making Num Banhchok in China after being exiled. The dish\u2019s popularity soared, capturing even the Chinese emperor\u2019s attention.\n\n\nLunch\n\n\n4. Samlor Korkor (Cambodian soup)\n\n\n \nThose acquainted with the country's rich gastronomic landscape will point towards Samlor Korkor as Cambodia's true national dish.\n\n\nSamlor Korkor is known for its adaptability. Its recipe can incorporate a wide range of seasonal vegetables. The dish also isn\u2019t limited to a specific type of meat, but it\u2019s typically made from pork belly and catfish. However, two ingredients central to Cambodian cuisine\u2014 prahok (fermented fish) and kroeung (curry paste)\u2014are always present, giving this food its distinctive taste. Toasted ground rice is also added to thicken the soup, offering a fuller texture and a subtle, nutty flavour. The rich and aromatic soup is often served alongside rice or rice noodles.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a lunch option, Samlor Korkor not only provides a hearty and nourishing meal but also showcases the depth and complexity of Cambodian culinary traditions. \n\n\n5. Num Pang (Cambodian sandwich)\n\n\n \nAmongst the city\u2019s street foods, Num Pang, a Cambodian sandwich reminiscent of the French baguette yet distinctly local in its fillings, stands as a testament to the city\u2019s culinary evolution. It features a short, crispy baguette with an airy texture, reminiscent of its French counterpart.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe versatility of Num Pang is showcased in its diverse variations. Num Pang P\u00e2t\u00e9 boasts a rich layer of p\u00e2t\u00e9 and cold cuts, complemented by mayonnaise, pickled carrots, radish, cucumbers, and fresh herbs.\u00a0\n\n\nNum Pang Brahet is another popular variant, featuring pork meatballs amid a colourful mix of mayonnaise, pickled vegetables, salad, and herbs, a favourite in Siam Reap. For seafood enthusiasts, Num Pang Trey Khaw offers fish simmered in tomato sauce, harmoniously blended with mayonnaise, pickled carrots, papaya, cucumber, and fresh herbs.\n\n\n6. Kha trei svay kchai (Caramelised fish with green mango salad)\n\n\nFor those seeking to immerse themselves in the authentic Cambodian culinary landscape, consider the Kha Trei Svay Kchai that marries sweet, savoury, and sour in a dance of flavours.\u00a0\n\n\nThe main ingredients include fish steaks, palm sugar for caramelisation, garlic for an aromatic touch, and fish sauce to enhance the savoury notes. Red tomatoes are added to the mix, offering a hint of acidity and freshness, while ground black pepper lends a mild heat to the overall flavour.\n\n\nThe dish is completed with a topping of sliced green mango, introducing a sour element that cuts through the sweetness of the palm sugar and the savoury notes of the fish sauce. The result is a balanced, flavourful salad dish that showcases the simplicity and elegance of Cambodian food.\n\n\nTea\n\n\n6. Prahok Ktis (Creamy prahok dip)\n\n\n \nCentral to this dish is prahok, a type of salty fermented fish that's a cornerstone in many Cambodian meals, known for adding an umami touch.\n\n\nIn Prahok Ktis, the pronounced flavour of prahok is mellowed and enriched by a blend of coconut cream and palm sugar. Minced pork is also mixed in, lending the dish added substance and savouriness. The result is a creamy, flavourful dip that is a favourite among locals and visitors alike.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a variant called Prahok Kroeung Ktis, where a spice paste made from roots adds another layer of aroma and taste to the mix. The dish balances the strong flavours and creates a richer taste profile.\n\n\nPrahok Ktis is typically served with an array of fresh, crunchy vegetables, offering a crisp, refreshing contrast to the creamy dip.\u00a0\n\n\nHave it as a snack during teatime when those hunger pangs strike!\n\n\n7. Kangkep baob (Stuffed frogs)\n\n\n \nFor those unacquainted with Cambodian food, the sight of grilled stuffed frogs can be interesting. Yet, any reservations you have will be quickly dispelled upon the first bite.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe outer layer, crisped to perfection, gives way to a juicy, flavourful interior where the medley of ingredients comes to life. The root spices lend an earthy depth, the chilies add a kick of heat, and the palm sugar imparts a delicate sweetness, making Kangkep Baob a balanced and delightful snack.\n\n\nYou can easily find it at roadside barbecues all over Phnom Penh.\n\n\nDinner\n\n\n8. Chrouk krao Chhnang (Out of the pot soup)\n\n\nChrok Krao Chhnang is typically served with steamed rice. Literally translating to \u201cout of the pot\u201d, the distinctiveness of Chrok Krao Chhnang lies in its unique preparation, which you guessed it \u2013 out of the pot. The chef simply gathers all the ingredients\u00a0 in a container and pour the boiling water inside to make broth.\u00a0 Typically, the main ingredient is fish or anchovies, topped with boiled egg, tomatoes, cucumbers and shallots. The broth is then allowed to cool, before seasoning and fresh aromatic herbs are added. Some Cambodians even add ice to the broth and drink it cold. This dish is popular during Cambodia\u2019s summer months of March and April. \n\n\n9. Kari Sach Moan (Chicken red curry)\n\n\n \nThe Cambodians typically have the Kari Sach Moan during special occasions.\n\n\nUnlike the intense spice often associated with curries from neighbouring regions, Kari Sach Moan is characterised by its delightful mildness. The use of large local red chilies, known for their vibrant colour yet moderate heat, allows for a curry that is rich yet mellow, welcoming to a broad range of palates.\n\n\nCentral to Kari Sach Moan is the chicken, tender and succulent, absorbing the medley of flavours infused in the curry.\n\n\n10. Lort Cha (Stir-fried rice noodles)\n\n\n \nPrefer something light for dinner? Lort Cha consists of stir-fried short rice noodles, known as rice pin noodles. These noodles are akin to the Vietnamese Banh Bot Loc and the Mee Tai Mak popular in Singapore and Malaysia.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIt\u2019s a fuss-free and delicious dish where the noodles are stir fried with soya sauce, fish sauce, vegetables like bean sprouts and green onion, and typically beef, pork or chicken.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough simple, it\u2019s a staple for the locals and a go-to for anytime of the day.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWrapping up this culinary exploration through Phnom Penh, it's evident that the city's diverse and exquisite cuisine is a direct reflection of its rich culture and history. As the capital, Phnom Penh is a melting pot of culinary traditions, providing an opportunity to savour local specialties and explore the nuances of Cambodian cuisine. And its vibrant street markets are probably one of the best ways to indulge in the unique and delectable offerings of Cambodian food!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nTiktok\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right into your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCambodia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\nEnjoyed this article?

Participation in the Changi Rewards Loyalty Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.\n \n\u201cProgramme\u201d\n refers to Changi Rewards, a customer loyalty programme owned and administered by Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (Registration Number 200910817N), a company incorporated in Singapore under the Companies Act (Cap. 50) (\n\"CAG\"\n).\n\n\n1.2.\n By registering for the Programme (subject to sections 1.5 and 1.6 below) (such registrant referred to as \n\u201cCardholder\u201d\n), it constitutes the Cardholder\u2019s consent to be bound by the Programme\u2019s terms and conditions as set out herein, as may be amended or varied by CAG from time to time (the \n\u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d\n).\n\n\n1.3.\n CAG will issue to each Cardholder an e-Card for purpose of the Programme (the \n\u201cChangi Rewards Card\u201d\n). Each Changi Rewards Card carries a unique number. It is the responsibility of the Cardholder to ensure that his Changi Rewards Card is fully registered by providing the information as required to register for the Programme at \nhttps://rewards.changiairport.com/signup.html\n and ensure that the information submitted is accurate, current and complete. Upon registering his Changi Rewards Card, the Cardholder will be able to redeem his Changi Rewards points and access his Changi Rewards account online at \nhttps://rewards.changiairport.com\n or via the Changi App.\n\n\n1.4.\n CAG reserves the right to terminate or amend the Programme at any time at its sole discretion.\n\n\n1.5.\n Subject to section 1.6. below, the Programme is open to all individuals for free enrolment except employees of appointed contractors or vendors who are directly involved in the Programme (such agencies as determined by CAG from time to time) and their immediate family members. Immediate family members refer to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law and siblings. Applicants must be 16 years and above at the point of registering for the Programme.\n\n\n1.6.\n Only individuals can register for membership for the Programme, and each individual is allowed to have only one registered Changi Rewards account. No corporations, trusts, partnerships or other legal entities can be enrolled as members of the Programme. CAG reserves the right to close a Cardholder\u2019s Changi Rewards account automatically and/or forfeit any Changi Rewards points, entitlements and rewards in respect of a Cardholder\u2019s Changi Rewards account if (i) no Changi Rewards points are credited or redeemed for a continuous period of five (5) years; or (ii) that Cardholder is found to have more than one Changi Rewards Card registered in his name; or (iii) as result of CAG\u2019s investigations, CAG believes that the Changi Rewards account is not being operated in accordance with the Terms and Conditions; or (iv) registration of the Changi Rewards Card is not completed within a period of two (2) years from the first transaction on that Changi Rewards Card, following which the Changi Rewards Card will be deemed an unregistered card and any and all earned Changi Rewards points, entitlements and rewards will be automatically forfeited.\n\n\n1.7.\n Without limitation to any other rights or remedies that CAG may have under law, CAG may do any one or more of the following if CAG suspects or determines that a Cardholder (whether alone or with others) has engaged in fraudulent or unauthorized activity in connection with his Changi Rewards account and/or Changi Rewards Card (such Cardholder referred to as \u201c\nFraudulent Cardholder\u201d\n, and such activity referred to as \n\u201cFraud Action\u201d\n):-\n\n\n(a) suspend or terminate the Fraudulent Cardholder\u2019s Changi Rewards account and Changi Rewards Card;\n\n\n(b) claw back all Changi Rewards points, entitlements and rewards issued by CAG in connection with the Fraud Action; and/or\n\n\n(c) file a police report for that Fraud Action.\n\n\nThe Cardholder shall indemnify CAG against all costs, claims, losses or damage of whatsoever nature suffered or incurred by CAG arising out of or in connection with the Fraud Action.\n\n\n1.8. \nIf any Cardholder terminates his Changi Rewards membership at any time, for any reason, all unused Changi Rewards points shall automatically be cancelled immediately and no longer be available for use by the Cardholder.\n\n\n1.9.\n CAG may, at its sole and absolute discretion and without prior notice, (i) modify, suspend or terminate the Programme; and/or (ii) modify, amend and/or vary these Terms and Conditions in such manner as CAG deems fit from time to time. CAG may notify Cardholders of change(s) in the Terms and Conditions by publishing such changes via the website at \nhttps://rewards.changiairport.com/terms-and-conditions.html\n, via email or by such other means of communication as CAG may determine in its absolute discretion, from time to time. Any changes in the Terms and Conditions shall be effective from the date of publishing the revised Terms and Conditions in the foregoing manner.\n\n\n1.10.\n Subject to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, CAG may disclose information regarding any Cardholder to any third party under a duty of confidentiality for the purposes of operating the Programme or any promotion hereunder.\n\n\n1.11.\n CAG's decision on all matters and disputes concerning the Programme shall be final and binding on all Cardholders.\n\n\n1.12.\n CAG shall have the absolute discretion to use agents, contractors or correspondents to administer and/or implement the Programme and CAG shall not be liable to any Cardholder or individual for any act, omission or neglect on the part of such agents, contractors or correspondents.\n\n\n1.13.\n All Changi Rewards points have no monetary value and can only be earned, redeemed or utilised in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Any other use, including but not limited to the sale, trade, transfer or exchange of Changi Reward points are strictly not allowed and will result in the forfeiture of the points in question, cancellation of rewards or immediate termination of Changi Rewards membership without prejudice to any rights or remedies available to CAG at law or in contract.\n\n\n1.14.\n CAG reserves the right to terminate the membership of any Cardholder at any time at its sole discretion without compensation. The Programme membership shall end automatically upon the death of the relevant Cardholder and all unredeemed Changi Rewards points shall be forfeited.\n\n\n1.15.\n By registering for this Programme, the Cardholder consents to CAG communicating to him the benefits and entitlements of his Programme membership via the email address and mobile number registered to his Changi Rewards account (\n\u201cMembership Updates\u201d\n). If the Cardholder opted in to \u201creceive exclusive deals, offers, promotions and events from Changi Rewards\u201d, that Cardholder also consents to receiving communications informing him about exclusive deals, promotional offers and events invitations, via the email address and mobile number registered to his Changi Rewards account (\n\"Membership Offers\"\n). The Cardholder may unsubscribe from Membership Offers anytime by updating his subscription preferences in his Changi Rewards account or clicking on the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link at the footer of any Membership Offers. Please note that the Cardholder will continue to receive necessary transactional and service announcements (e.g. account statements and amendments to the Terms and Conditions) and Membership Updates even if he opted out of Membership Offers. If the Cardholder writes in to CAG to withdraw his consent to Membership Updates, CAG will not be liable to that Cardholder if he is not notified of the Programme benefits and entitlements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Changi Account Terms and Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\n These Terms and Conditions will be subject to the \nChangi Account Terms and Conditions\n, which will form part of the contract between the Cardholder and CAG.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. General Use of Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.\n The Changi Rewards Card is non-transferable and the use thereof is solely restricted to the individual to whom and in whose name the Changi Rewards Card is issued to and for use strictly for purpose of the Programme only.\n\n\n3.2.\n Each Cardholder shall at all times hold one Changi Rewards Card only.\n\n\n3.3.\n The Changi Rewards Card is a privilege card and it must be presented prior to all purchases in order to be entitled to the benefits conferred by the use of the Changi Rewards Card.\n\n\n3.4.\n Cardholders may contact CAG for questions regarding their transaction history or any correction, or dispute on any transaction or correction that has been assessed against their Changi Rewards Card. CAG will conduct an investigation and communicate the results to the Cardholder and correct any error (if applicable).\n\n\n3.5.\n It is the responsibility of Cardholders to keep CAG updated with their latest mailing address, email address, mobile number and/or other communication preferences. CAG is not liable for any misdirected materials sent to Cardholders\u2019 mailing address, email address, mobile number and other communication preferences on record, or any consequences thereof.\n\n\n3.6. \nIf a Cardholder\u2019s physical Changi Rewards card is lost, damaged, or destroyed, Changi Rewards will not replace that card. The Cardholder would have to sign up for a Changi Rewards e-Card via \nhttps://www.changiairport.com/en/rewards/signup.html\n, and please write in to us through the \nContact Us\n webform to transfer all existing and valid Changi Rewards points in respect of the Cardholder's physical Changi Rewards card to the new Changi Rewards e-Card.\n\n\n3.7.\n Cardholders shall be liable for any unauthorised use of their Changi Rewards Card and shall indemnify CAG against any claims, losses or damage of whatsoever nature arising out of or in connection with any unauthorised use of the Changi Rewards Card.\n\n\n3.8.\n For Cardholders requesting a name change to the Changi Rewards Card, proper legal documentation (as may be requested by CAG) is required.\n\n\n3.9.\n Each Changi Rewards Card shall at all times remain the property of CAG and the relevant Cardholder shall cease to use his Changi Rewards Card immediately when his Programme membership is terminated or suspended.\n\n\n3.10.\n Statements of accounts are available to the Cardholder online when he logs into his Changi Rewards account at \nhttps://login.changiairport.com/en/account/login/\n, at \u201cTrack Your Points\u201d or via the Changi App. Each statement will show the number of Changi Rewards points earned and redeemed for the past 12 months. The total number of unredeemed Changi Rewards points outstanding and available as at that date will also be reflected with the corresponding expiry date.\n\n\n3.11.\n \nUse of Changi Rewards Card for GST Absorption when Shopping at Singapore Changi Airport (\u201cChangi Airport\u201d) Public Areas\n\n\n3.11.1. With effect from 1 Jan 2024, only registered Changi Rewards Card holders will enjoy \n9% GST absorption\n for their purchases when they shop at participating retail outlets located at Changi Airport's public areas.\n\n\n3.11.2. A registered Cardholder refers to a Cardholder who has registered his Changi Rewards Card with the following mandatory personal particulars and has agreed to the Programme\u2019s terms and conditions via the Changi Rewards website\n\n\na) First Name and Last Name;\n\n\nb) Date of birth;\n\n\nc) Country of residence;\n\n\nd) Mobile number; and\n\n\ne) Email address\n\n\n3.12.\n Cardholders must present their Changi Rewards Card prior to making payment for their purchases to be entitled to \n9% GST absorption\n for their purchases made at participating outlets.\n\n\n3.13.\n Participating retail outlets of the GST absorption programme are listed \nhere\n (latest as of Dec 2023, may be updated by CAG from time to time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Issuance of Changi Rewards Points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.\n\u00a0Changi Rewards points shall be awarded to Cardholders based on the Nett Spend amount shown on each receipt for qualifying purchases at all participating retailers on a per receipt basis (up to a maximum Nett Spend amount of $5,000 per receipt, except for Monarch tier Cardholders with no cap on the maximum nett spend amount per receipt), subject to these Terms and Conditions. Please see section 4.8 for the list of non-participating retailers at Changi Airport. Please also see \nJewel Double Rewards\n for the list of non-participating outlets in Jewel Changi Airport.\n\n\n4.2.\n With a minimum Nett Spend of S$10 in a single receipt, eligible Cardholders will be awarded with Changi Rewards points based on the following earn rate:\n\n\na) Member tier Cardholders will earn 10 points for every block of S$10 Nett Spend in a single receipt;\n\n\nb) Gold tier Cardholders will earn 20 points for every block of S$10 Nett Spend in a single receipt; and\n\n\nc) Platinum tier Cardholders will earn 60 points for every block of S$10 Nett Spend in a single receipt;\n\n\nd)\u00a0Monarch tier Cardholders will earn 80 points for every block of S$10 Nett Spend in a single receipt.\n\n\n4.2A\n\u00a0Where the Nett Spend amount in a single receipt is more than S$5,000, the maximum number of Changi Rewards points that will be awarded to eligible Cardholders is as follows:\n\n\na) Member tier Cardholders \u2013 5,000 points;\n\n\nb) Gold tier Cardholders \u2013 10,000 points; and\n\n\nc) Platinum tier Cardholders \u2013 30,000 points.\n\n\nFor Monarch tier Cardholders \u2013 there is no cap on the number of Changi Rewards points.\n\n\n4.3.\n \u201cNett Spend\u201d refers to the final payment amount as calculated according to Section 4.4 below and rounded down to the nearest S$1. For the purposes of illustration:\n\n\na) A Gold tier Cardholder with a Nett Spend of S$38 in a single receipt will be entitled to 60 Changi Reward points (i.e. receipt amount rounded down to nearest S$10 block and multiplied by the Gold tier earn rate of 20 points per S$10 Nett Spend); and\n\n\n\n\nb) A Member tier Cardholder with a Nett Spend of S$71 in a single receipt will be entitled to 70 Changi Reward points (i.e. receipt amount rounded down to nearest S$10 block and multiplied by the entry tier earn rate of 10 points per S$10 Nett Spend).\n\n\n4.4.\n In calculating the Nett Spend, all discounts given and amounts paid using vouchers (including, but not limited to, Changi e-Voucher(s) and Changi e-Voucher(s) Flexi) shall be excluded, i.e. such amounts are to be excluded when calculating the total qualifying spend in a single receipt. Nett Spend excludes spend at non-participating outlets as well as temporary event and short-term leased outposts.\n\n\n4.5.\n In the event of a dispute arising out of or in connection with the transactions made with the Changi Rewards Card under the Programme, the transaction records of CAG relating to the Programme shall be deemed conclusive and binding on the Cardholder. The Changi Rewards Card must be presented at the point of sale in order for the Changi Rewards points to be awarded to the Cardholder and issued to the relevant Changi Rewards account. No Changi Rewards points will be awarded in respect of any amount paid using Changi e-Voucher(s), in-store vouchers, or any other promotional vouchers. Retrospective claims of Changi Rewards points in respect of prior purchases will not be entertained.\n\n\n4.6.\n A Cardholder may earn Changi Rewards points only in relation to transactions which are entered into by him. Cardholders are not entitled to collect points on transactions entered into by any other individual, including but not limited to family members, friends, acquaintances or business colleagues. Cardholders are not entitled to claim or collect points on transactions entered into prior to the date of their enrollment in the Programme.\n\n\n4.7.\n In the event that: (i) the Changi Rewards machine is not working in the relevant outlet at the time of transaction; or (ii) Cardholders forget to present their Changi Rewards Card at the time of transaction, CAG may, as a discretionary gesture of goodwill, credit Changi Rewards points to the subject Cardholders if the relevant receipts for qualifying transactions are sent to Changi Rewards through the Contact Us \nwebform\n or chat with MAX. Such receipt(s) must be in good condition and not more than 7 days old as at the date CAG receives such receipts. Changi Rewards points will only be credited for retrospective claims made by registered Cardholders at the point of transaction. CAG reserves the right at its sole discretion to decline to credit Changi Rewards points for transactions in this manner if CAG has reasonable grounds for believing that one or more of the claims being submitted is either fraudulent or not in compliance with these Terms and Conditions, and in all circumstances CAG\u2019s decision shall be final.\n\n\n4.8.\n\u00a0Changi Rewards points will not be awarded for charges arising from banks, money changing facilities, top up cards facilities and purchases (including cards sold by tenants with cash top-up capabilities such as food court top up card, gift card, cash card, phone card, etc.), postal and postage services, medical services, bank/airline lounges,\u00a0transit hotels, hotel reservations,\u00a0 telecommunication services, car rental services, airport shuttle and transportation services, passenger meeting services, left luggage services, tour and travel services, dry-cleaning services, temporary event and short-term leased outposts, and such other items or services as may be determined by CAG from time to time. Changi Rewards points will also not be awarded for any tobacco products purchased at any participating outlets in Changi Airport, Kopitiam and canteens across Changi Airport terminals. Refer to \nJewel Double Rewards\n for the list of non-participating outlets in Jewel Changi Airport.\n\n\n\n\n4.9.\n The Changi Rewards points awarded to and redeemed by a Cardholder will be stated in the Changi Rewards Card transaction receipt of the Cardholder, and may be corrected or revised by CAG at any time to correct any errors in the computation of Changi Rewards points.\n\n\n4.10.\n In the event where the purchases were made without the requisite Changi Rewards points being credited to the relevant Cardholder, such Cardholder shall (if intending to claim the relevant Changi Reward points) furnish the necessary proof of purchase (i.e. receipts).

This decal is required for parking at any of the 21 designated Monarch reserved parking lots and CAG will reissue new decal for qualified Monarch members upon the expiry of the decal. Unauthorised parking (i.e. vehicles without Monarch decal and/or vehicles which IU number is not registered under the Monarch Cardholder\u2019s Changi Rewards profile) will be subject to wheel-clamping.\n\n\n8.6.5. CAG and/or its carpark contractor reserve the rights to request from the vehicle owner who parked at the Monarch reserved lot for any form of identification to prove that he is a Monarch Cardholder.\n\n\n8.6.6. The use of any of the designated Monarch reserved parking lots by Monarch members is restricted to a maximum of 24 hours from the time of entry at the relevant car park, so that the reserved parking lots can be freed up for more Monarch members\u2019 usage. Any vehicle parked at a Monarch reserved lot for more than 24 hours will be wheel-clamped and subject to a fee, based on the prevailing rate as set out in the\u00a0\nAirport Parking Terms & Conditions\n,\n\u00a0which has to be paid to CAG to remove the wheel clamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Lounge Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Platinum Cardholders only\n\n\n9.1.\n\u00a0Each Platinum Cardholder will receive two (2) lounge passes (\u201cPass\u201d) per Upgraded Tier Validity Period once upgraded to Platinum status. The last issuance of Passes will be on 30 June 2024. Starting from 1 July 2024, Passes will no longer be issued to Platinum Cardholders.\n\n\n9.2.\n Pass is valid for 12 months from the date of issuance for a one time use only. Each pass admits one person per pass.\n\n\n9.3.\n Pass is for 3 hours lounge access at participating lounges at Plaza Premium Lounge located at Changi Airport Terminal 1, Ambassador Transit Lounge located at Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3, Blossom Lounge located at Changi Airport Terminal 4 (collectively, the \n\u201cLounges\u201d\n and each, a \n\u201cLounge\u201d\n).\n\n\n9.4.\n Pass is non-transferable and must be presented together with a valid Changi Rewards Card at the Lounge for redemption. Entry to the respective Lounges is subject to that Lounge\u2019s prevailing terms and conditions. The Lounges reserves the rights to request for any other form of personal identification.\n\n\n9.5.\n CAG shall not be liable or responsible to any Cardholder or any other individual(s) who access any of the Lounges under the Programme (all such Cardholders and individuals who access any of the Lounges referred to as \n\u201cLounge User\u201d\n) for any claims, demands, loss, damages, compensations, liabilities, actions, lawsuits, charges, penalties, fines, costs and expenses of whatever nature arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with the use of any of the Lounges, including but not limited to:-\n\n\n9.5.1. any loss, loss of use, theft, and damages of baggage or any property or valuables of any Lounge User;\n\n\n9.5.2. any illness, personal injuries or death of any Lounge User and/or any other individuals occurring in the Lounge for whatever causes; and\n\n\n9.5.3. any consequential loss, financial or otherwise, for any flight cancellation, delay or missed flight for whatever reasons whilst the Lounge User using the Lounge; and/or any act, omission (including negligence), failure, default or breach by the Lounge operator, its directors, employees, officers, agents, contractors and sub-contractors in providing Lounge services to the Lounge User.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.

Located in Perak, Malaysia, it has come a long way since the tin rush era which lasted till the 1970s and was one of the most productive tin-producing districts then. After several decades of fighting a slow fade into\u00a0obscurity, Ipoh has reclaimed its popularity, with its old-time colonial charm adding to this resurgence.\u00a0\n\n\nBeyond the Ipoh hor fun (flat rice noodles) that is synonymous with the town, here\u2019s our roundup of must-visits when in this\u00a0beautiful and underrated city.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a reason to travel? Enjoy discounted fares on Scoot to regional destinations from 11 February 2025 to 3 March 2025. Keep your eyes peeled for new cities weekly! \nBook now!\n\n\n1. Wander through the streets of Ipoh Old Town\n\n\n \nWith the\u00a0Kinta River running through the city of Ipoh, it has become a\u00a0familiar and oft-used demarcation between the old town and the new town.\u00a0\n\n\nLocated west of Kinta River lies the iconic Ipoh Old Town. When you\u00a0step into the city centre, it almost feels like you\u2019ve been transported back in time.\u00a0You will find colonial era architectural elements standing tall and lining the streets at almost every corner. Little refurbishing has been made to the building facades, but you notice that the moss-covered brick walls and chipped, faded paint adds a certain character and charm to the otherwise dilapidated\u00a0infrastructure.\n\n\n \nStart the morning on a hearty note at an Old Town establishment, Kong Heng Restaurant. With some luck, you\u2019ll be able to find a seat in the busy kopitiam (coffeehouse), which already comes to life in the early hours of the day. Prepare to be\u00a0greeted by\u00a0enthusiastic hawkers, eagerly\u00a0waiting to share their menus with you. Take some time to soak up the atmosphere before making your selection.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nEven if\u00a0heavy and filling breakfasts aren\u2019t your thing, we suggest making an exception while you\u2019re here. Order the famed Ipoh-style Chee Cheong Fun (steamed flat rice noodles), often topped with a homemade mix of soy sauce and shallot oil, along with a roll or two of Popiah (spring rolls), lovingly prepared by the same elderly lady who has\u00a0helmed the store for many years.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 75 Jalan Bandar Timah, 30000 Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Opens for breakfast and lunch daily. Closed on Wednesdays\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nOnce you\u2019ve savoured breakfast, a stroll through the city square is in order. Just round the corner is Kong Heng Square, a big\u00a0pavilion that is home to the town\u2019s burgeoning artisan market. With vines hanging and entwined around pillars and the brick\u00a0walls of the century-old mansion, it might feel like you\u2019ve stepped into an oasis that\u2019s lost in time. Amble along the rows of boutiques and kiosks selling handcrafted knick-knacks and other bespoke goods, before popping into Plan B, a trendy coffee shop that has a raw, industrial feel coupled with touches of greenery for a quick coffee break and a slice of cake.\u00a0\n\n\nAlong the way, don\u2019t\u00a0forget to stop by a laneway or two for quick photo ops\u00a0against the striking art murals lining the walls.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKong Heng Square\n\n\nAddress:\n Kong Heng Square: 30000 Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily\n\n\nPlan B\n\n\nAddress:\n Plan B: No. 75, Jalan Panglima, 30000 Ipoh, Negeri Perak, Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily\n\nMondays to Thursdays: 10AM \u2013 11PM\n\nFriday: 10AM \u2013 12AM\n\nSaturday: 9AM \u2013 12AM\n\nSunday: 9AM \u2013 11PM\n\n\n2. Explore one of Ipoh\u2019s many limestone caves\n\n\nAnother reason why Ipoh is such an underrated travel destination is that it\u2019s actually home to some of the most\u00a0spectacular sights which double up as cultural and even religious landmarks. With a wealth of limestone mountains in the area comes an equally huge number of caves that are up for exploration.\n\n\n \nMake your way to Kek Lok Tong\u00a0Temple, located east of the Kinta River. At first glance, it\u00a0might seem like just an ordinary limestone cave. But as you carefully traverse through the cave, you\u00a0might find hints of something beyond the natural world\u00a0\u2014\u00a0altars and traditional murals set into the caverns and peeking out from between the\u00a0stalactites, a common sight in many of these caves.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n \nContinue making your way\u00a0through, and you will eventually reach a clearing at the other face of the mountain. Here,\u00a0you\u2019ll be greeted by the captivating sight of green hills and vales, and wisps of clouds moving across these marvels. Walk through the zen garden and soak up the tranquillity and clean, cool breeze.\u00a0Spend the afternoon up here and even pack a light snack to enjoy alongside the spectacular view.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Pesiaran Sepakat 3, Tmn Endah Jaya, 31350 Ipoh, Negeri Perak, Malaysia.\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily, 7AM - 5.30PM\n\n\n \nFor those who want to explore more temples along the same stretch, Ling Sen Tong Temple is a short 10-minute\u00a0drive, or a 30-minute walk\u00a0away. Literally translated as the Rock of Heavenly Spirits, the temple is nestled away in a slightly quieter\u00a0part of town and offers a different experience.\u00a0 Expect a galore of brightly coloured statues \u2013 ranging from animals, deities, and other characters from classic Chinese folklore, including the popular tale, Journey to the West.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 31350 Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA must-eat in Ipoh, this roasted duck from Sun Yeong Wai boasts succulent meat, crispy skin and delectable sauces to complement its flavours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of cultural immersion, pay a visit to the famed Sun Yeong Wai Roasted Duck Restaurant, located just minutes away from either of the temples by car. While known for its crispy duck skin and tender-soft duck meat, the restaurant also serves up a decent\u00a0barbecued\u00a0pork along with an array of meat and\u00a0vegetables that often remind its patrons of\u00a0home-cooked meals.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n No. 17 & 19, Jalan Sri Ampang, Taman Ipoh Jaya, 31350 Ipoh, Negeri Perak, Malaysia.\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily, 10AM - 7.30PM\n\n\n3. Eat your way through Ipoh\n\n\nWhile Ipoh has seen a rise in the number of\u00a0restaurants and joints that cater to a more western palette, the authentic Ipoh flavours are still a crowd favourite among the tourists and locals alike. To put it simply \u2014\u00a0no trip to Ipoh is complete without visiting some of its iconic food establishments.\u00a0\n\n\nStart your morning at Sin Yoon Loong for breakfast and a cup of the famous Ipoh white coffee, which reportedly originated from this store. Locally known as kopi\u00a0putih, the\u00a0white\u00a0coffee preparation\u00a0begins with beans roasting in a layer of margarine to bring out the flavours of the coffee. It is then mixed together with condensed milk and served in a vintage porcelain\u00a0kopi\u00a0(coffee) cup that\u2019s often\u00a0adorned with animal and floral motifs.\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 15A, Jalan Bandar Timah, 30000 Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily.\u00a0\n\n\n \nOnce you\u2019ve had your caffeine hit, it\u2019s time to make your way down to Thean Chun Coffee Shop for another local dish\u00a0\u2014 Chicken Kuey Teow Soup, otherwise known as Ipoh\u00a0Kai See Hor Fun. An unassuming dish that truly warms the soul, the flat\u00a0and smooth rice noodles are steeped in a bowl of piping hot chicken broth and garnished with slivers of chicken meat.\u00a0Once you\u2019re done\u00a0wolfing down this bowl of goodness, cleanse the palette with their signature caramel custard dish that melts in your mouth.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 73 Jalan Bandar Timah, 31650 Ipoh, Negeri Perak,\u00a0Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily from 8AM - 3PM, except for Thursdays\n\n\n \nFor a wider variety of dishes, it\u2019s also worth paying a visit to the Dim Sum Street of Ipoh, where you will be spoilt for choice by the variety of restaurants. Known to be a local favourite, Ming Court Hong Kong Dim Sum retains its old-school Chinese restaurant appeal, from kitschy floor tiles right\u00a0down to the well-worn metal trays that the service crew use to dish out small plates of\u00a0dim sum around the\u00a0establishment. Choose from over 50 different types of dishes but take caution not to make the mistake we did of\u00a0over-ordering! It is known to get crowded\u00a0especially during the weekends, so be prepared to wait.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \n50 Jalan Mustapa Al-bakri, Taman\u00a0Jubilee, Ipoh, Malaysia\n\n\nOperating Hours:\n Open daily, from 10.30AM until sold out\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIpoh boasts an eclectic array of activities and food options at an affordable price, giving people more options when exploring the city. For those seeking a cultural trip coupled with good local food, Ipoh is\u00a0definitely one location not to miss.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a reason to travel?

Ask those living near the Persian Gulf though, and they will tell you a holiday in Bahrain is unlike any other.\u00a0\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with this Arab country, here\u2019s more information on Bahrain. The largest city in Bahrain is Manama, which is also the capital of the country. Manama is known for its modern architecture, including the Bahrain World Trade Center and the Bahrain Financial Harbor, which are among the tallest buildings in the country. These landmarks are examples of the largest city's status as a major financial hub in the Middle East.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain also has several man-made islands to provide more space for housing, commercial, and tourism developments. One of the most notable ones include Amwaj Islands, which are known for its lagoons and beaches for water sports.\n\n\nBesides Amwaj Island, there are also plenty of historic sites, gorgeous scenery of modern skyscrapers and, of course, shopping over in the mainland of Bahrain. For starters, here are the eight tourist attractions you must visit while in this desert country. \n\n\n1. Learn about Bahrain\u2019s history at the Bahrain National Museum\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHistory buffs, rejoice because one place you can\u2019t leave Bahrain without visiting is the Bahrain National Museum. With such a long, extensive and complex history, the best place to begin understanding this Middle Eastern country is here.\u00a0\n\n\nThe national museum of Bahrain is located at the capital city\u2019s waterfront and is bursting with archaeological finds, interactive exhibits and photographs showcasing over 6,000 years of rich history.\n\n\nThere\u2019s also a temporary exhibition hall and an art gallery with ever-rotating displays in this public museum. You can also visit the Bu Maher Fort (more on this major attraction a little later) via a boat ride from the museum!\n\n\nInstagram-savvy holidaymakers will be glad to know there\u2019s a bougie lil cafe inside the museum too. The best part of all? It faces the sea, so you can sit back and enjoy \na cuppa\n while gazing out at the blue waters in the capital city.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \nManama, Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Wednesday to Monday \u2014 9:00am to 8:00pm\n\n\n2. Go pearl diving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDue to its rich natural reserves, most of Bahrain\u2019s economy was reliant on the seas around the country for a few thousand years \u2014 not for seafood, but rather for pearls. Divers would scour the seabed for pearls, which were then either sold as exports or turned into fine Bahraini pearl jewellery.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nWhile most pearls today are farmed all across the world, you can still dive for oysters (and, in turn, pearls) here in Bahrain. Not only is there the UNESCO-protected Bahrain Pearling Path to check out, but there are also five different licensed pearl-diving operations you can approach. And yes, whatever you can find, you\u2019re allowed to keep!\n\n\nEven if you don\u2019t find any\u2013though highly unlikely\u2013being able to swim in the turquoise blue waters is a treat in itself.\n\n\nFor more exhibitions and photography about the pearl industry, you can also head down to the Bu Maher Fort where the Pearl Museum is located.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBu Maher Fort address: \nMuharraq, Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Wednesday to Monday \u2014 9:00am to 6:00pm\n\n\n3. See the Tree of Life\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPicture this: A vast, sandy, and hot desert, there\u2019s no water for miles around, no apparent nutrient in the form of soil, and the temperature ranges from scorching hot in the day to blimey cold at night. And yet, one lone tree stands tall for over 400 years.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Tree of Life, or Shajarat-al-Hayat in the local language, is a Bahrain miracle with visitors coming from all over the land to witness this popular attraction themselves. This tree has even got a 4.2-star review on Google, with reviews calling it inspirational and magical, even.\n\n\nScientists themselves also aren\u2019t completely sure where exactly the tree gets its water from \u2014 perhaps from spring reserves a long distance away \u2014 but as the local stories go, it\u2019s the God of Water, Enki, that blesses the tree (and thus the lands) with water. They also consider it the location of the Garden of Eden.\n\n\nGetting there requires a set of wheels which you can easily rent in Bahrain. It\u2019s about a two-hour drive from Jebel Dukhan, with signs pointing to where the Tree of Life is.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAddress:\n Dirt Road to Tree of Life, Jebel Dukhan, Bahrain\n\n\n4. Visit the Royal Camel Farm\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCamel rearing has been part of the royal family\u2019s culture for centuries as they served as the main means of transport then. Though cars have pretty much taken over their role today, the Royal Camel Farm continues to exist to preserve the heritage.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nHere, you can take pictures with the camels, feed them (the baby camels are especially cute) and even try some camel milk too!\n\n\nSome visitors might feel disturbed seeing the male camels with restrictions around their legs, but it\u2019s done to prevent them from kicking one another, usually to the point of death, when the females are in heat. They\u2019re also all spaced apart so they can\u2019t bite one another either. Meanwhile, the females and babies get to roam around the pens.\u00a0\n\n\nAs the workers don\u2019t earn much, it\u2019s recommended to give them a tip to show your appreciation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \nJanabiyah, Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 7:00am to 5:30pm\n\n\n5. Shop through Manama Souq\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThere are many shopping malls in Bahrain, but the Manama Souq is worth a visit. A souq [read as souk]\u00a0 \u2014 a traditional market made up of little stalls with their traders lined up along the backstreets \u2014 is a treasure trove of untold goods you won\u2019t find back in Singapore.\n\n\nBefore stepping into the back alleys you\u2019ll already smell the scent of Arabic incense and spices wafting through the air. Here you\u2019ll find varieties like Indian chai and Iranian saffron, as well as lamps, perfumes, kaftans and handwoven rugs! Don\u2019t forget to bring along \na bag \nfor all your loot.\n\n\nThere are also a wide range of \nelectronic goods\n, t-shirts and shisha pipes for sale too. Haggling is part of the experience if you\u2019re confident in your language skills. Some of the popular street \nsnacks\n there include Rani Far Far (made of potato starch and sago) and Zalabia (a swirly fried dough soaked with a lemon and saffron infused syrup). Remember to head to these \nexercise gyms in Singapore\n for a workout once you\u2019re back!\n\n\nCome Saturdays, the customs square Babal al Bahrain down the road also organises another market. Not only is there live music by local musicians, but they\u2019ve also got traditional sweets and antiques too.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Bab Al Bahrain Ave, Manama, Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours: \nSaturday to Thursday \u2014 9:00am to 1:00pm, 4:00pm to 9:00pm, Friday \u2014 4:00pm to 9:00pm\n\n\n6. Go animal watching and plant spotting at Al-Arin Reserve\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Al-Arin Reserve is an impressive natural sanctuary covering an area of 7 square metres - a must-visit for all nature lovers. This remarkable reserve provides a safe haven for a variety of unique wildlife and plant species, supporting a biodiverse ecosystem. The nature reserve is home to an astounding 100,000 plant specimens with 25 different species. It also houses more than 45 animal species and over 80 species of birds.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nNotably, the park also includes a comprehensive facility for animal care, boasting a veterinary clinic and a hospital specifically for falcons.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n P.O. Box 28690, Kingdom of Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours: \nEvery day throughout the year from 9:00am to 4:00pm\n\n\n7. Learn more about the Quran, Islamic art, calligraphy & history at Beit Al Quran\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nImmerse yourself in an extraordinary journey through Islamic history at Beit Al Quran, also known as the \"House of the Quran,\" nestled in the vibrant capital city of Bahrain. It is widely regarded as one of the most notable Islamic museums in the world. The complex includes a mosque, library, school, and the museum itself.\u00a0\n\n\nAs you step into the museum, 10 distinct exhibition halls invite you to explore different eras and aspects of Islamic art and calligraphy. From early Quranic parchments to intricate Islamic art pieces, the museum offers a profound journey into the heart of Islamic civilisation.\u00a0\n\n\nDelight in the variety of Qurans, some inscribed on unconventional materials like rice, grain, and even textiles - a testament to the creativity and reverence that has shaped this sacred text over centuries since ancient times.\n\n\nThe stunning architecture of Beit Al Quran is a spectacle in itself, inspired by the style of old Madinah houses and Islamic architectural heritage. Its stunning dome replicates the one in the 9th-century mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia, underscoring the deep historical ties within the Islamic world.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Building No.17, Rd No 1901, Manama, Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 8:30\u202fam\u20132:30\u202fpm on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday. 8:30am-1:30pm on Thursday and Saturday. Closed on Fridays.\n\n\n8. Watch the sun set on Bahrain Fort\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLast but not least is the Qal\u2019at al-Bahrain, or the Bahrain Fort. This 16th-century Portuguese fortress is the most important archaeological site in Bahrain as it sits on the land that once served as the ancient civilization of Dilmun, aka the Land of Immortality. It is also one of Bahrain\u2019s two UNESCO World Heritage sites.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIt feels somewhat unreal being able to walk around such a historical site. Over the years, many relics have been unearthed, including ancient tablets dating back to the days (circa. mid-15th-century) when King Agum III was believed to have ruled. Most of these relics are on display in the museum next door. Music performances by local artists are sometimes held here.\u00a0\n\n\nCome sundown, head on over to the top of the fort. From there, the view of the sun setting over the horizon, beaming over the skyscrapers in the distance and the vast expanse of the fort in front of you is something to behold.\n\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of forts? Check out Riffa Fort, also known as Sheikh Salman bin Ahmad Fort. This historic landmark is located in Riffa, the second largest city in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Over at Riffa Fort, visitors can explore a number of rooms and halls including a kitchen,\u00a0 Sheikh's room, majlis (a room for social gathering), and a beautifully decorated room for women.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \n892 3618, Karbabad, Bahrain\n\n\nOpening hours: \n8:00am to 8:00pm\n\n\nCheck Bahrain off your bucket list \n\n\nWho would\u2019ve known the small country of Bahrain (just slightly larger than Singapore) would have so many things to see and do? The next time you can\u2019t decide on where to go on holiday, consider Bahrain. Otherwise, we\u2019ve got a list of \ntop destinations to visit in 2023\n for you to choose from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful travel information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight in the comfort of your own home.

Savour delectable cuisine, and soak in the artistry that adorns every corner. The city is vast and ancient, filled with so many archaeological monuments. It can honestly be a little intimidating, trying to figure out which attractions to visit and which fun things to try.\u00a0\n\n\nFret not, here\u2019s a list of must-see wonders and lesser-known sites in the Eternal City. Whether you\u2019re a new explorer or a seasoned visitor, there's always something new to do and see in Rome. Make sure to read to the end for some useful travel tips!\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nHistorical sites to marvel at\n\n\n1. Colosseum\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYou honestly can\u2019t say that you\u2019ve visited Rome without seeing the Colosseum. The Roman Colosseum is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and is one of the most popular sights in the city.\u00a0\n\n\nThis colossal amphitheatre, commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in AD 72, is a testament to the grandeur of Roman engineering and innovation. Its awe-inspiring structure once hosted gladiatorial contests and public spectacles, becoming a nexus for entertainment and political displays. Today, the Colosseum remains an enduring symbol of Rome's imperial past, offering visitors a tangible connection to the city's rich heritage. Stepping into the arena, one can almost feel the echoes of the past, envisioning the roaring crowds and the legendary battles that unfolded within its walls.\n\n\nThe best time to visit is early in the morning on weekdays before the crowds start to form. Alternatively, a pro tip is to visit the Colosseum on a nighttime tour as the venue lights up and will be crowd-free. You can book tickets and packages from the official website that grants entry to various sections of the Colosseum, like the arena, underground area, or Bellevue area.\n\n\nLike most major tourist attractions in Rome, security is stringent at the Colosseum. You will not be allowed entry with large bags or \nluggages\n. It is recommended to pack light so that you can clear the security checks efficiently and spend more time touring the site.\n\n\n2. Palatine Hill\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNext to the Colosseum lies the Palatine Hill, the tallest of seven hills that Rome is built on, housing the ruins of luxurious palaces that once housed emperors and aristocrats. Its significance is deeply intertwined with the foundation of Rome itself, as legend has it that this was the site where Romulus founded the city in 753 BC.\n\n\nSitting just 40 metres below is the Roman Forum, a collection of magnificent historical buildings that were built in ancient Rome. The place is essentially the heart and origin of the Roman Empire thousands of years ago.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe best part is that your Colosseum ticket grants entry to both popular attractions! You can also choose to join a guided tour as there are many stories to learn about while strolling through these historic sites. Be sure to bring along some \nsunscreen\n and plenty of fluids as the area can get quite sunny during the day.\n\n\n3. The Pantheon\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Pantheon is one of the few buildings from ancient Rome that has remained completely intact. Its iconic dome, an architectural marvel even by modern standards, is a testament to the ancient Romans' mastery of concrete construction.\n\n\nVisiting the Pantheon costs \u20ac5 (S$7.30) per adult, while those under 18 can still visit for free. However, don\u2019t let this deter you from visiting as the Pantheon is more than just a simple museum. Upon entering, you will quickly be taken in by the marvel of its architecture and opulence.\n\n\nWe recommend booking your entrance tickets online to save time from queuing up for walk-in admissions. An audio guide will be included with your ticket, which can be downloaded on your phone. \n\n\n4. Spanish Steps\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnother reason why a visit to the Pantheon shouldn\u2019t be skipped is because of its proximity to many other sights in Rome. Some of the must-sees include the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Piazza Navona; all of which are about seven minutes away from the Pantheon.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Spanish Steps consists of 138 steps and three unique terraces. Try climbing all the way up as the peak truly offers a beautiful view of your surroundings. However, avoid sitting down or eating whilst on the steps as you may be imposed with a \u20ac400 (S$584) fine! These laws have been implemented to protect the steps as it is a UNESCO World Heritage site. \n\n\n5. Trevi Fountain\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter spending time at the Spanish Steps, you can head west for the Trevi Fountain. It is the largest fountain in Rome, and definitely worth seeing. While here, you might see people throwing coins into the fountain. This is due to myths of the Trevi Fountain. It is said that if you throw one coin, you will return to Rome someday. If you throw two coins, you will find love in Rome. If you throw three coins, you will marry the person that you love. To achieve the \u2018desired effect\u2019 of this myth, you should throw the coin with your right hand over your left shoulder.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n6. Piazza Navona\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMoving on is Piazza Navona, the most spectacular square of Baroque Rome. Over the centuries, Piazza Navona has hosted many festivals, races, and rides. From beautiful churches to the three famous fountains, there is much to see. Day and night, Piazza Navona has a large merry-go-round of shops and restaurants. It is the perfect place to eat at and shop to your heart\u2019s desire!\n\n\nSince these locations are in open public spaces, you can visit them at any time during your holiday. Do pace yourself when visiting these locations, as crowds may get rather heavy during the midday and afternoon hours.\n\n\nExplore the Vatican City\n\n\nVatican City is nestled within Rome\u2019s historic centre and is the world\u2019s smallest sovereign state, led by the Pope. Whether you are seeking a deeper connection to your faith, or simply an immersive experience in art and history, the Vatican City State is the place to be.\n\n\n1. Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStanding proudly in the heart of Vatican City is Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica, the most important Catholic church in the world. However, you don\u2019t have to be religious to visit this architectural marvel! Entry to the Basilica is free but the lines can be as impressive as the building itself. We recommend arriving by 7:00am to beat the crowds or take a guided tour, for a more comfortable experience. As a bonus, you can plan your trip with a Papal Audience on Wednesdays to see the Pope!\n\n\nAs it is a holy venue, visitors to Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica must be dressed appropriately or else you will be turned away at the door, regardless of how long you\u2019ve been waiting.\n\n\n2. Vatican Museums\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFinally, a trip to Vatican City isn\u2019t complete without a tour of the Vatican Museums. The Vatican Museums are housed in a complex of buildings, showcasing some of the most renowned masterpieces in the world. You may need to set aside at least half a day to see the Vatican Museums due to how extensive it is.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nFrom the iconic frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, painted by the masterful hand of Michelangelo, to the Raphael Rooms and the Gallery of Maps, the Vatican Museums house an extraordinary array of masterpieces that span centuries. Beyond its artistic riches, the museums also hold cultural and historical significance as they provide a glimpse into the papal legacy and the Vatican's role in preserving and promoting art.\n\n\nAvoid visiting on Sundays as the museums are closed. However, the last Sunday of each month is a \u2018free entry\u2019 day to the Vatican Museums. While the idea of free entry is tempting, we recommend avoiding it as the crowds will be even more massive.\n\n\n3. Sistine Chapel \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLocated towards the end of the Vatican Museums, lies the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo's awe-inspiring frescoes, notably the iconic ceiling and the Last Judgment, adorn the chapel's interior, creating an immersive experience that transcends time and space.\n\n\nTickets for the museums will grant you access to the Chapel as well, however, there is no separate ticket for visiting the Chapel on its own. If you are short on time, following signs marked with \u2018Cappella Sistina Percorso Breve\u2019 (Sistine Chapel short route) will allow you to beeline straight towards the Sistine Chapel after entering the Vatican Museums.\n\n\nLike Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica, visitors must be appropriately dressed, or risk being denied entry. As of 2020, the Vatican Museums operate on shifts.

As the saying goes: when in Rome, do as the Romans do!\n\n\nBest time to visit\n\nThe Eternal City of Rome is enchanting throughout the year, each season offering its unique charm. The ideal time for a visit is typically in the spring, from April to June, and in the fall, from September to October. These months are characterised by mild temperatures and fewer tourists, providing a more comfortable and intimate experience of the city's splendours. Summer in Rome, stretching from June to August, tends to be hot and is also the peak tourist season, making the city's famous sites more crowded. Winter, spanning from November to March, offers cooler weather and fewer crowds, ideal for those who prefer a more tranquil exploration of Rome's rich history and indoor tourist attractions.\n\n\nCurrency\n\nThe official currency in Italy is the euro (\u20ac). For convenient and hassle-free currency exchange, \nuse Changi Recommends FX\n. You can buy currencies at real-time exchange rates and collect your euros at Changi Airport before your departure. Check out this guide on \ngetting the most out of your currency exchange\n.\n\n\nTransportation\n\nMost of the popular attractions are connected by public transport. Buses are one of the most efficient ways of getting around the city. You can purchase the Roma Pass online, which grants free use of Rome\u2019s public transport and discounted tickets to major tourist attractions, for two or three days. Additionally, tap-to-pay on your smartphone can be used for the metro.\n\n\nReservations\n\nRomans love reservations, and restaurants tend to fill up quickly, especially in the evening. Try to call restaurants for a booking before visiting popular places to eat in Rome, or head there as soon as the shop opens for the best shot at getting a table.\u00a0\n\n\nMost shops will accept card payment, but it is always handy to carry cash with you. The occasional restaurants, cafes and shops will only accept cash.\n\n\nPacking\n\nWalking around the city\u2019s many attractions can get exhausting, therefore it is important to be prepared! Bring along a \nwater bottle\n in your day pack as drinking fountains that dispense potable water can be found throughout the city. Avoid bringing excessive and unnecessary gear to clear security checks faster when visiting attractions.\n\n\nMany of Rome\u2019s famous sites such as the Sistine Chapel and Saint. Peter\u2019s Basilica, require visitors to be appropriately dressed \u2013 meaning your shoulders, knees and chest should be covered. Wear comfortable \nshoes\n too as you will be walking around a lot.\n\n\nOther tips\n\nIf possible, try to arrange for your accommodation to be near the Pantheon. This allows you to be in central Rome, granting easy access to places like Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona on foot. It also means that you can reach them early in the morning before the crowd!\n\n\nLastly, be sure to always keep your valuables close and safe as pickpockets are not unheard of when visiting Rome. Check your belongings often and be vigilant! For an added peace of mind, remember to buy \ntravel insurance\n before flying.\n\n\nBook now\n\nTravelling to Rome, Italy begins with a flight from Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) to Rome's Leonardo da Vinci\u2013Fiumicino Airport (FCO).

This is because the Changi Return\u00a0e-Voucher will be issued to you via the Changi App.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you do not have an existing Changi Rewards membership, you may sign up before the point of purchase, and scan your Rewards Card upon payment.

You will not be able to combine receipts to hit the minimum spend, or receive more than two S$10 Changi Return e-Vouchers on the same day. As such, so long as you meet the S$100 minimum spend in \na single receipt\n, you will be awarded with a S$10 Changi Return e-Voucher in a day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the promotion limited to one Changi Return e-Voucher per customer?   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Changi Rewards member who meets the minimum spend is entitled to one Changi Return e-Voucher issued per day. If the Changi Rewards\u00a0member meets the minimum spend on a second receipt on another day, the customer can still receive a second S$10 Changi Return\u00a0e-Voucher.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI qualified for the promotion and received the Changi Return e-Voucher to my Changi Rewards account. On my next trip out of Singapore, I redeemed the e-Voucher. At the same time, I had met the minimum spend in Transit, in a single receipt. Will I be issued another Changi Return e-Voucher for this transaction?   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, each Changi Rewards\u00a0member will be rewarded with one Changi Return e-Voucher per day. If the Changi Rewards member travels out of Singapore 5 times during campaign period, the member can receive 5 x $10 Changi Return e-Voucher (provided he meets the minimum spend on each trip). This is also subject to the Changi Return\u00a0e-Vouchers still being available for giving out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will the Changi Return e-Voucher be issued? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you qualify, the Changi Return e-Voucher will be automatically issued into your Changi Rewards Account, which you may access through the Changi App. The Changi Return\u00a0e-Voucher will be found under \u2018Vouchers, Prizes & Redemptions\u2019 in your Changi App account. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI qualified for the promotion by meeting the minimum spend, but I do not see the Changi Return e-Voucher in my Changi Rewards account. Why?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Changi Return\u00a0e-Voucher will automatically be issued to your Changi Rewards account via the Changi App after 24 hours after the qualifying purchase is made.

It is not applicable on iShopChangi. It also cannot be used for purchase of any tobacco products.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I redeem the Changi Return e-Voucher?   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will receive an \u2018offer\u2019 on Changi App, which will direct you to your Changi Rewards card.

Can I stack the vouchers?   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, the Changi Return\u00a0e-Vouchers cannot be stacked in a single receipt. The Changi Return e-Vouchers can be redeemed on a 1 per Changi Rewards member per transaction basis. Therefore, if you have 5 Changi Return\u00a0e-Vouchers in your Changi Rewards account you may utilise all 5 Changi Return\u00a0e-Vouchers on the same day, so long as you make 5 transactions in the same day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any brand exclusions? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor The Shilla Duty Free, brand exclusions are Chanel and Dior.

If you are looking to explore beyond Seoul and its many popular tourist attractions, Jeonju is one of the most extraordinary places near the capital of South Korea you should be adding to your bucket list \u2013 it is less than a 2hr train ride from Seoul via the high-speed KTX trains. This charming city is a perfect day or overnight trip for travellers, and a beloved weekend getaway for locals.\n\n\nAppointed as the Creative City of Gastronomy by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in May 2012, Jeonju is steeped in cultural heritage and culinary traditions. But that is not all. With over a thousand years of history, this cultural district in the southwestern corner of the country is where modern life meets traditional terms.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nTime slows down in this city, so take a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, tour all the must-see sights and indulge in all the delicious and authentic Korean dishes in Jeonju for exciting new adventures.\n\n\nWhere to visit: Jeonju Hanok Village and its vicinity\n\n\n1.

So, how can we forget about food in this culinary city? Home to some of the most representative dishes in South Korea, here are \nsome Korean foods you must eat\n in Jeonju.\n\n\n1. Savour Jeonju traditional Bibimbap, right from its homeland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeonju traditional Bibimbap is served with mung bean jelly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibimbap (Korean Mixed Rice), one of Korea\u2019s most iconic dishes, was born in Jeonju. The traditional version of this mixed rice dish comprises over 30 diverse ingredients, but what sets Jeonju Bibimbap apart are five key elements that create its unique flavour: bean sprouts, red pepper paste, soybean paste mixed with soybean sauce, fresh meat, and the signature yellow mung bean jelly. If you are a foodie looking for a culinary adventure, make sure to try the Jeonju Bibimbap and savour the distinctive flavours that have made it a local favourite.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n \nYou will also find other variations of this Korean mixed rice, including some garnished with beef tartare (yukhoe) and egg yolk or with hot pepper paste mixed with fried beef served with bean sprout soup. There are plenty of restaurants serving the dish in the Hanok village, so you can pop in any of them, but here are what we recommend for a flavourful Bibimbap fix!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n45 years Traditional Bibimbap Jongno Hoegwan 45\ub144\uc804\ud1b5\ube44\ube54\ubc25 \uc885\ub85c\ud68c\uad00\n\n\nAddress:\n 60-2 Jeon-dong, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea (\n\uc804\ubd81 \uc804\uc8fc\uc2dc \uc644\uc0b0\uad6c \uc804\ub3d9\uc131\ub2f9\uae38 98\n)\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 10:50am to 8:30pm, daily\n\n\nGogung Suragan Hanok Village Branch \uace0\uad81\uc218\ub77c\uac04 \ud55c\uc625\ub9c8\uc744\uc810\n\n\nAddress:\n 31, Eunhaeng-ro, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea (\n\uc804\ubd81 \uc804\uc8fc\uc2dc \uc644\uc0b0\uad6c \uc740\ud589\ub85c 31 \uace0\uad81\uc218\ub77c\uac04 \ud55c\uc625\ub9c8\uc744\uc810\n)\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 11:00am to 8:30pm, daily (last order at 8:00pm)\n\n\n2.

Named one of the top hangover cures by National Geographic UK, this soup dish is boiled with various spices and is served with brown rice, making it a unique and flavourful Korean soup.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen ordering, the waiter will ask you if you want sliced green chilli and spring onions, which add to the fragrance but may make it too spicy for those with low spice tolerance. Most bowls are served with a half-boiled egg and salted seaweed. Mix the egg well with a few spoons of Kongnamul broth and enjoy the delicious bowl of egg, where the broth enhances the flavour of the egg instead of the other way around. For meat lovers, add boiled squid to your soup.

Slurp on delicious handmade knife-cut noodles from Veteran Kalguksu\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecialising in Kalguksu (Korean knife-cut noodle soup), Veteran serves one of the most distinct knife-cut noodles in the country. Unlike the usual knife-cut noodles, which are served in a clear broth, this smothered broth has an egg-drop soup consistency, adding a rich and savoury flavour to the chewy noodles. Topped with red pepper powder, crunchy seaweed flakes, and perilla seeds, each spoonful is a burst of flavour. To complete your meal, try its Pork and Kimchi Mandus (dumplings).\n\n\nBe prepared to remove your shoes and be seated on the elevated floor as you dine, just like the locals do. As with other popular eateries, you can expect a crowd, but the wait is worth it to experience the hype around this restaurant.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVeteran Kalguksu \ubca0\ud14c\ub791 \uce7c\uad6d\uc218\n\n\nAddress:\n 135 Gyeonggijeon-gil, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea (\n\uc804\ubd81 \uc804\uc8fc\uc2dc \uc644\uc0b0\uad6c \uacbd\uae30\uc804\uae38 135\n)\n\n\nOpening hours: \n9:00am to 8:00pm, daily\n\n\nWhere to find mouthwatering street snacks in Jeonju \n\n\n1.

Do not forget to grab a box of these delectable pies before leaving Jeonju and share them with your loved ones!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPNB \ud48d\ub144\uc81c\uacfc\n\n\nAddress: \n61-1 Eunhaeng-ro, Pungnamdong, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea (\n\uc804\ubd81 \uc804\uc8fc\uc2dc \uc644\uc0b0\uad6c \uc740\ud589\ub85c 61\n)\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 8:30am to 9:30pm\n\n\nPNB Pungnyeon Bakery Main Branch \n\n\nAddress: \n180 Paldal-ro, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea (\n\uc804\ubd81 \uc804\uc8fc\uc2dc \uc644\uc0b0\uad6c \ud314\ub2ec\ub85c 180\n)\n\n\nOpening hours: \n8:00am to 10:30pm\n\n\nWhere to stay in Jeonju\n\n\nExperience the Korean way of living in an overnight Hanok stay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Korean Inns are available in and around Jeonju Hanok Village.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, many Hanoks are used as guesthouses or hotels, blending modern amenities with traditional architecture. Some Hanoks provide comfortable raised beds while others offer mats and blankets, so take your pick on modern comfort in a traditional fa\u00e7ade or sleep on the floor like a true-blue Korean native. Most of the accommodations around Jeonju Hanok Village are housed in the Hanok fa\u00e7ade, so if you prefer something even more modern, opt for an Airbnb dwelling or hotel that is located further away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nJeonju is such a charming city in South Korea that it should be on every traveller\u2019s bucket list. From its well-preserved Hanok Village to its famous Korean food, there is so much to explore and experience. I hope my guide got you inspired to check out the amazing sights and delectable eats in Jeonju yourself. K-drama fans will also be thrilled to revisit some of the popular Netflix drama \u201c\nTwenty-Five Twenty-One (2521)\n\u201d filming spots. If you are thinking of a visit soon, plan your trip early and book your transportation ahead of time to avoid disappointment. Jeonju is a true gem that harmoniously blends cultural heritage and modern traditions, a must-visit for anyone travelling to South Korea.\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTiktok\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Travel Information\nTravelling to Jeonju\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight in the comfort of your own home.

For me, it\u2019s South Korea! Whether you are a first-time traveller to South Korea or an expert in finding the best local experiences, the land of kimchi promises new and exciting adventures all the time.\n\n\nIf you are looking for an escape from the hustle and bustle of cities like Seoul and Busan, Jeju Island could be the destination for your next getaway. Often referred to as the Hawaii of South Korea \u2013 Jeju is home to golden beaches, coastal trails, fascinating museums, lava tubes and many more attractions.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nEach district on Jeju Island has its own unique charm and must-visits, so let this multifarious island convince you to plan a quick visit or spend more time there for a much-needed retreat.\n\n\nLook no further as we share with you some of the best things to do and eat, and the best places to visit in Jeju.\n\n\n1. The showdown between Dongmun Traditional Night Market and the modern Sumokwon Night Market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEat and shop till you drop at the largest market on Jeju Island, the Dongmun Traditional Market. Image credit: Visit Jeju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst up, the Dongmun Traditional Market should not be missed! As the most representative marketplace in Jeju, you will find common sights of a traditional market in Korea. From fresh seafood stalls to a flea market and a night bazaar, it is popular among tourists and locals alike. Treat yourself to some \nstreet food\n as you shop for affordable \nsouvenirs\n and other local specialties.\u00a0\n\n\nFind out why this is the local market of choice when food stalls at Gate 8 open after the sun sets. From local delicacies like chopped-up steak and grilled lobster to Korean staples such as abalone kimbap (seaweed rice roll with fillings) and dakgalbi (spicy stir-fried chicken), be spoiled by a plethora of choices. Be prepared to queue and enjoy your food on-the-go as you soak yourself in the bustling night market scene.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDongmun Traditional Night Market\n\n\nAddress\n: 20, Gwandeok-ro 14-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n\n\nOperating hours\n: November to April\u20146:00pm to 12:00am, May to October\u20147:00pm to 12:00am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy your evening at one of the most happening night spots on Jeju Island \u2014 the Sumokwon Night Market. Image credit: Visit Jeju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for trendy instead of traditional, the Sumokwon Night Market promises a surprise. Nestled in Sumokwon Theme Park that is open to the public, the night market is the first to be built inside a pine forest, bringing visitors closer to nature. You can find a wide selection of food trucks, cute photo spots, countless outdoor picnic benches and well-decorated booths selling local specialty and handmade products within the night market \u2013 leaving you spoilt for choice.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is where you can enjoy modern fusion \nKorean food\n like the Jeju special black pork burger, giant turkey legs, and fresh pineapple juice amongst the vast greenery! Expect yourself to spend at least two to three hours at this quieter and less mainstream spot.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSumokwon Night Market\u00a0\u00a0\n\n Address\n: 69 Eunsu-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju\n\n\nOpening hours\n: Winter season\u20145:00om to 10:00pm, Summer season\u20146:00pm to 11:00pm\n\n\n2. Savour the authentic local Jeju delicacies\n\n\n \nTopping the island\u2019s must-eat list is no doubt the Jeju black pork. Touted as the best pork in South Korea, this local breed is said to have a unique taste and is juicier than ordinary pork meat. It is so popular that a street is devoted to it in Jeju \u2013 the Black Pork Street.\u00a0\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nAll the restaurants along the street specialise in black pork and you can\u2019t go wrong by hopping into any of them. If you prefer planning your trip in advance, you may want to book your table ahead of time for some of the top picks \u2013 the Michelin-starred Dombedon, local-favourite Hwaro Hyang, and Donsadon, which all serve black pork over charcoal. Thinking about the juicy, melt-in-the-mouth textured meats just makes me want to plan for a trip back to Jeju again!\n\n\nFor those who are looking for a second round of feasting, the Dongmun Market \u2013 Jeju's largest and oldest permanent market with a night market serving all kinds of local delicacies \u2013 is just within walking distance away. Else, you may want to consider taking an enjoyable stroll along the adjacent Chilsungro Shopping Street \u2013 the Myeongdong of Jeju, for some unique shops and caf\u00e9s.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress\n: Black Pork Street - 25 Gwandeong-ro 15(sibo)-gil, Geonip-dong, Jeju-si, Jeju-do, South Korea\n\n\n \nComing close behind is the Hae-mul-tang (spicy seafood stew). Served in a hotpot with an abundance of fresh seafood including octopus, squid, clams and abalones, this mouthwatering seafood soup is a real local delicacy. The broth gets sweeter as the meal progresses, as the seafood boils in the broth and lends its flavour to everything else in the pot. This dish goes particularly well with Korean \ndrinks\n like soju, ice-cold beers and Makgeolli.\u00a0\n\n\nAt Samseonghyeol Haemultang, a famous outlet loved by tourists, the stew is served in a large pot for sharing among four people, or you can opt for a small single pot and have it served with ramen.

Explore Jeju\u2019s triple UNESCO Natural Heritage Sites on the east coast\n\n\nWith three United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) sites, the east coast is best known for stunning sights. Crowned as the first World Heritage Site in South Korea, the Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes comprises the Hallasan, Geomun Oreum Lava Tube System and the Seongsan Illchubong, with each promising a unique experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a hike up Hallasan and enjoy one of the greatest views of Jeju from the peak. Image credit: Visit Jeju\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallasan is the tallest and biggest peak in South Korea and regarded as one of her most sacred mountains. Said to be home of spiritual immortals and has given rise to many local myths and legends, it is well loved and respected by locals. The Hallasan offers jaw-dropping views from the edge of a volcano and could very well be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for adventure seekers.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are four main trails on the mountain but only two bring you all the way up the crater tip! For the best views, conquer the Hallasan on the Gwaneumsa Trail (approximately 17.4km). This route will take abou eight to 10 hours on a return trip and is recommended for seasoned hikers. If you would like an easier journey, trek along the Seongpanak Trail (approximately 19.2km) instead. This is a gentler route and will take you about seven to nine hours to complete.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe perfect combination seems to be taking the Seongpanak trail up and Gwaneumsa trail down. Taxis are seen queuing along the foot of the Gwaneumsa trail, so a ride out of the mountain could be all you need should your legs feel too tired after the hike! If this sounds too challenging for you, consider a two-hour return hike on the Eorimok or Yeongsil Trails to soak in the atmosphere of the lush forest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHallasan\n\n\nAddress\n: 2070-61, 1100-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n\n\nOpening Hours\n: Open all year round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmire Jeju\u2019s unique and stunning lava features in a subterranean atmosphere at Manjangul Cave. Image credit: @brian_di.ch from Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the Geomunoreum Lava Tube System is a series of over 20 lava tubes located adjacent to one another. Amongst these, the Manjanggul Lava Tube which stretches over 7.4km, is one of the most well-conserved lava tubes in the area. With only 1km open to the public, visitors can expect an eye-opening experience from the variety of cave topographical features and the largest lava column in the world.\u00a0\n\n\nA return trip will take you approximately two hours. Dress warmly or bring along a sweater as temperatures in the cave could fall below 15 degrees Celsius even in summer! Dress in comfortable shoes and be careful of the uneven terrains, natural potholes and puddles of water.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManjangul Cave\n\n\nAddress\n: 182, Manjanggul-gil, Jeju-si, Jeju-do\n\n\nOpening Hours\n: 9:00am to 6:00pm daily (last admission at 5:10pm)\n\n\nAdmission fees\n: KRW4,000 (S$4.03) for adults, KRW2,000 (S$2.02) for teenagers and children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimb up the Seongsan Ilchubong for 360-degrees awesome views of Jeju Island and fresh air. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong considered one of the top scenic spots in South Korea, Seongsan Ilchulbong (also commonly known as Sunrise Peak) is the only hydromagmatic volcano with one of the most well-preserved tuffs (rock formation following an eruption) worldwide. This 182m-high tuff volcano takes the shape of a large pie and is the most popular location on the island to catch the sunrise.\u00a0\n\n\nThose looking at the full Seongsan Ilchulbong experience, can expect to spend two hours here. You can chill at the peak with your travel buddies, soak in the breathtaking panoramic views of the oceans and Jeju Island, and capture as many photos as you can for the memories. Put on your workout outfit and get ready for legs day as the flights of stairs could be quite steep, but I promise that the picturesque views from the peak are totally worth it!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSeongsan Illchulbong \n\n\nAddress\n: 284-12, Ilchul-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do\n\n\nOpening Hours\n: 9:00am to 6:00pm daily \n\n\nAdmission fees\n: KRW5,000 (S$5.04) for adults, KRW2,500 (S$2.52) for teenagers and children\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI hope my guide inspires you to visit one of my favourite holiday destinations when you\u2019re looking to travel overseas from Singapore.

The vibrant city brims with a plethora of exciting activities for travellers of all ages. Now that holidaying is slowly but surely making its comeback, here are six new varieties of things to do in Bangkok during a quick weekend getaway, on top of your usual shopping at Chatuchak Weekend Market and feasting in eateries along Yaowarat Road (Chinatown in Bangkok).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. Visit the state-of-the-art mall by the river, ICONSIAM (Opened in end-2018)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with visiting a glitzy Bangkok mall for some retail therapy. Check out the newest kid on the block \u2014 the ICONSIAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMake a 10-minute ride across the Chao Phraya river and what will soon come into view is Bangkok\u2019s shiniest new mall, ICONSIAM \u2013 boasting a night market with delicious dining options and luxury shopping all under one gorgeous roof. After a days\u2019 worth of filling your bags with just about everything anyone could possibly want, make your way up to one of the mall\u2019s various rooftop restaurants to dine and sip on wine as the setting sun bathes the pretty Bangkok skyline in all its reddish-orange splendour. If you\u2019re looking for great views and even better fare, Baan Khanitha\u2019s a good a place to start as any, offering authentic Thai food and fine cocktails to pair.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuck into a variety of delicious dining options at Bangkok\u2019s glitzy new mall, the ICONSIAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen dinner\u2019s done, stroll along the night market that brims with a different energy altogether. The sights, sounds, and smells of a classic night market fill the air \u2013 except weather-proof and safe from the elements \u2013 making it a comfortable, yet \nauthentic experience\n regardless. Flowing through the heart of the indoor night market is also a mini river-like water feature, adding a picturesque touch to an already-exciting landscape.\n\n\nAnd as if all that wasn\u2019t reason enough to make a trip down, surely the unique experience of getting ferried to the mall via a complimentary boat ride might tip the scales for you.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGetting there:\n Board the free ICONSIAM shuttle boat at either Sathorn Pier or Si Phraya Pier, operating from 9am to 11pm daily\n\n\nAddress:\n 299 Charoen Nakhon Rd, Khlong Ton Sai, Khlong San, Bangkok 10600, Thailand\n\n\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 10:00am to 10:00pm daily\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. Caf\u00e9-hop at the quaint Ari region (Opened in 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove a good Insta moment? Then you simply have to visit Gump\u2019s Ari to explore the cafes and snap some Instagram-worthy photos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nSeekers of Instagram-worthy caf\u00e9s couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to learn of a new region that\u2019s dubbed Bangkok\u2019s trendiest neighbourhood, and is home to quaint caf\u00e9s that are great for those who want a slow afternoon. With a pastel pool-like photo spot and rows of cafes in the vicinity, you just might mistake Gump\u2019s Ari for South Korea\u2019s famed Stylenanda caf\u00e9. And in a similar fashion, there are also rows of photo booths so that you can snag a piece of the unique neighbourhood home.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet your caffeine kick in between all the exploring from Grafika Coffee Stand at Gump\u2019s Ari.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf \ntea\n is how you prefer to be caffeinated, then the bittersweet, creamy Matcha Latte from Grafika Coffee Stand is a must-try. In a never-before-done move, I had two lattes one after the other because it was just that good. Grafika offers the usual suspects like coffees and dirty lattes for those who\u2019re looking to switch things up just a tad. Lunch is also covered, with no shortage of dining options in the \nGump\u2019s Ari\n space. If you\u2019re up for it, Fats & Angry (yes, you read that right) is an American diner concept serving hearty shakes and burgers just the way you like it.\n\n\nGetting there:\n 9 mins\u2019 walk from Ari BTS station\n\n\nAddress:\n 25 Ari 4 Fang Nua Alley, Samsen Nai, Phaya Thai, Bangkok 10400, Thailand\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Monday to Friday \u2014 10:00am to 8:00pm, Saturday to Sunday \u2014 10:00am to 8.30pm\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. Cuddle with furry friends at an animal caf\u00e9 (Reopened in 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Little Zoo Caf\u00e9 Instagram Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHaving moved to their new location in On Nut, Little Zoo Caf\u00e9\u2019s renewed space sees vast areas for visitors and furry ones alike to interact with one another. Here, you\u2019ll get up close and personal with the likes of raccoons, corgis, fennec foxes, meerkats, owls, hedgehogs, guinea pigs, cats, the list goes on. If you have a soft spot for all things \nsmol\n just like me, the Little Zoo will be your slice of fuzzy heaven for the next couple of hours you\u2019ll spend here.\n\n\nThey also have a caf\u00e9 that\u2019s dedicated for humans to refuel with \ncoffee\n, desserts, and other treats before resuming cuddle time with the tiny, furry ones. Be sure to always have your phone on standby and ready to capture the antics that await.\n\n\nGetting there: \n9 mins\u2019 walk from Ari BTS station\n\n\n\n\nAddress:\n 486 On Nut Rd, Khwaeng Suan Luang, Suan Luang, Bangkok 10250, Thailand\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 11:00am to 8:00pm daily\n\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n4. Eat your heart out at the new and improved Jodd Fairs (Opened in 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLovers of Bangkok\u2019s night markets can be reunited with what they adore at Jodd fairs. Eat and shop your way through this elevated night market experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe (re)opening of Jodd Fairs brought hope to the previously despairing fans of Rot Fai night market and along with it, a bigger, bolder and more organised attraction. Now located in the Rama region, Jodd Fairs, and all its glistening fairy lights, is easy to spot even from a distance away.\u00a0\n\n\nThose familiar with the night market can expect the same classics such as \nLeng Saap\n (Thai dish of boiled pork bones served with a spicy sauce), a variety of fried goodness like chicken, squid, and quail\u2019s eggs, and other Thai street food, as well as retail favourites like dresses, tees and bags. Essentially, it\u2019s everything you came here for with an improved market layout that\u2019ll make your shopping experience breezier, neater, cleaner and more socially distanced.\n\n\nGetting there:\n 5 mins\u2019 walk from MRT Phra Ram 9\n\n\nAddress:\n Rama IX Rd, Huai Khwang, Bangkok 10310, Thailand\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 4:00pm to 12:00am daily\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5. Dine at 747 Caf\u00e9 - a repurposed Boeing 747 aircraft in the Ladkrabang district (Opened in 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow often can you wine, dine and party in a Boeing 747? Well, you can do just that in the world\u2019s largest airplane eatery, the highly-raved 747 Cafe. Image credit: 747 Caf\u00e9 Facebook Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis unique restaurant and bar experience inside an old Boeing 747 plane is really just fan service for all aviation geeks out there. Relive your days in the now retired aircraft that once held the grand mantle of Queen of the Skies.\n\n\nWith an entrance ticket of 120 Thai Baht (approximately S$4.54, and of which its value can be used to offset your meal), you can pick up lunch and some drinks from Cafe 747\u2019s lounge area. By day, the aircraft houses cafe-goers hoping to snag a cup of coffee, but by night, the area around the gargantuan airliner transforms into Club 747 \u2013 a space that comes to life after dark. Think live music, occasional themed nights and drinks aplenty.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll also get a chance to sit in the captain\u2019s seat in the 747 cockpit \u2013 a rare privilege that doesn\u2019t come by every day.\u00a0\n\n\nGetting there:\n 10 mins\u2019 drive from Suvarnabhumi Airport\n\n\nAddress:\n 627 1 Luang Phaeng Rd, Khwaeng Thap Yao, Khet Lat Krabang, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon 10520\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 10:00am to 7:00pm daily\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6. Benjakitti Forest Park (Fully opened in 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with nature right in the middle of the sprawling city, at Bangkok\u2019s Benjakitti Forest Park. Image credit: khaosodenglish.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a cash crunch but want to spend your time meaningfully, then the Benjakitti Forest Park is where you should go. Free-to-access and within walking distance from Queen Sirikit MRT, the park boasts plenty of flora, fauna, waterways, and most importantly, stunning views at dusk.\n\n\nIt completed its expansion plans last December, and is looking more gorgeous than ever. The extensive walking trials pave the way for an excellent post-dinner stroll or a romantic spot to bask in nothing else but the presence of each other and nature. At the same time, its convenient location in the heart of the city makes it a great stop for when you just want to slow things down.\u00a0\n\n\nGetting there:\n 2 mins\u2019 drive from Queen Sirikit MRT\n\n\nAddress:\n Ratchadaphisek Rd, Khlong Toei, Bangkok 10110, Thailand\u00a0\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 5:00am to 9:00pm daily\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe next time you\u2019re carting out that plane ticket to \nBangkok\n, be sure to add a couple (or all!) of these places to your itinerary for a refreshed trip to the land of smiles. It's only fair to experience Bangkok with a renewed sense of wonder \u2013 your revived travelling deserves adventure, fulfilment, and a side of novelty.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTikTok\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n,\u00a0\nand\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Travel Information\nTravelling to Bangkok, Thailand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight in the comfort of your own home.

With China offering visa-free travel to Singaporeans, why not consider a trip to Haikou, where a combination of natural splendours and cultural wonders awaits you.\u00a0\n\n\nA port city sited at the north coast of China's island province Hainan, the city is known for its intermix of Chinese and colonial European architecture. Imagine watching history unfold through the intricately designed buildings as you stroll along Qilou Old Street, or letting the tropical breeze caress your face at Holiday Beach. Whether you're a culture vulture hungry for Hainan's rich heritage, showcased brilliantly at places like the Hainan Museum, or an outdoor enthusiast eager to explore the lush landscapes of Evergreen Park, Haikou offers an adventure for every type of traveller. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into our definitive guide and uncover the best things to do in Haikou that'll make your first visit absolutely unforgettable.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nDiscover the must-visit attractions in Haikou\n\n\n1. Haikou Volcanic Cluster Global Geopark\n\n\n \nTucked away in the picturesque Shishan Town, west of Haikou city, the Haikou Volcanic Cluster Global Geopark serves as a stunning gateway to Haikou's fiery past. This must-see Haikou attraction unveils a variety of extinct volcanic craters and intricate lava landscapes that look like they're straight out of a fantasy world.\n\n\nWhether you're an avid geologist or a casual nature lover, the park's hiking trails offer a hands-on opportunity to explore these geological wonders up close. Immerse yourself in the marvels of the Earth's dynamic crust, all while taking in breathtaking vistas.\n\n\nA key attraction not to be missed is the Mt. Maanling (Saddle) Crater Scenic Area that consists of two major volcanoes - Mount Fengluling and Mount Baoziling. When seen from afar, the protruding peaks between the two volcanoes resemble a saddle. There\u2019s also a trail circling the Fengluling crater which will lead you to the top of the crater. Here, you\u2019ll arrive at the highest point in Haikou and be greeted with panoramic views of Haikou city. For visitors keen to learn more about volcanoes, there are also exhibits of volcanic landscapes and lava structures at the park.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress\n: Shishan Village, Xiuying District of Haikou City, Hainan Province\n\n\nEntrance Fee\n: 60RMB (S$11.40), free entry for children under 1.2 metres.\n\n\nOpening Hours\n: 8:00am to 6:00pm.\n\n\n2. Qilou Old Street\n\n\n \nStep back in time as you wander along Qilou Old Street, a historic gem located in the bustling Zhongshan Road area. Qilou, translated to Chinese arcade houses, are similar to the shophouses in olden Singapore where the ground floor is used as a shop, with living quarters on the upper floors. This charming avenue is much more than just a street \u2014 it's a living museum and a central part of what to do in Haikou.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nFeast your eyes on the well-preserved arcade-style buildings that line the street. These architectural marvels serve as the backdrop for quaint tea houses and shops selling traditional Chinese items, elevating it from a mere roadway to a must-visit Haikou attraction.\n\n\nBe sure to pop into one of the traditional teahouses for a sip of authentic Chinese tea.

For avid experience seekers, stay in Melbourne city centre as a base for easy access to an excellent array of food choices, and also have the option to travel out to seek different adventures.\u00a0\n\n\nExplore the Grampians National Park, get close to some native animals, or just chill out at Yarra Valley\u2019s numerous vineyards. Here are some top activities to check out and things to see for when you next go Down Under!\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a reason to travel? Enjoy discounted fares on Scoot to regional destinations from 11 February 2025 to 3 March 2025. Keep your eyes peeled for new cities weekly! \nBook now!\n\n\n1. Hike the Grampians National Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape the city and discover the natural beauty of Grampians National Park on a day trip from Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy a day\u2019s escape from Melbourne with a day trip to Grampians National Park. Located about three hours away from Melbourne\u2019s city centre by car, the Grampians National Park is made up of towering mountain ranges, with waterfalls and beautiful rock formations. This is a \nmust-visit attraction\n for those who love a scenic hike out in nature. Climb up to the Boroka Lookout for unparalleled views of the mountain range. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbark on a hike to visit Mackenzie Falls on your day trip from Melbourne, one of the largest waterfalls in Victoria. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor waterfall lovers, stop at the majestic MacKenzie Falls and Silverband Falls. My personal favourite was MacKenzie Falls \u2013 you can enjoy unobstructed views of the wide cascading waterfall that offers majestic sights. Getting to the observation deck involves a steep climb downwards (260 steps), and you will have to climb up the same trail to exit. \nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Halls Gap in Grampians National Park, where you can get up close to kangaroos and enjoy scenic hikes amidst breathtaking nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet up close to the kangaroos, surrounded by nature's wonders at Halls Gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are an animal lover looking for places to visit, you can explore the local town of Halls Gap, nestled in the heart of the Grampians National Park, and get up close and personal with kangaroos! Basic fitness is needed to go on the \nnature trails\n, or just take it at your own pace with rest stops to ensure adequate rest.\u00a0\n\n\nBook a day tour if you prefer not to go on a long drive to the national park and back to Melbourne's city centre \u2013 the day trip will likely take a full day (from 8:00am to 9:00pm) to complete, inclusive of driving time.\n\n\n2. Get up close to Koalas and Penguins on Phillip Island\n\n\nPhillip Island is an excellent place for animal lovers and those who are travelling with kids. Situated just two hours from Melbourne\u2019s city centre by car, it is a popular day trip choice due to its scenic beauty and relatively short drive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get within close reach of the penguins on Phillip Island, and note that photography is not allowed once the sun sets and when the penguins come ashore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarvel at the world's largest little penguin colony on Phillip Island as these charming creatures waddle ashore in waves. (Photo credit: Phillip Island Nature Parks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Phillip Island, you can find the largest little penguin colony in the world. One of the most exhilarating things to do is seeing these penguins waddle home from the sea to land every evening, wave after wave, for about an hour. Book your tickets early before leaving Melbourne to visit the \nPenguin Parade\n, as tickets do get sold out for the premium seating (where you can get much closer to the penguins!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet up close to these adorable koala bears at the Koala Conservation Reserve on Phillip Island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also visit the Koala Conservation Reserve, where you can stroll along the tree-top boardwalks to see these sleepy creatures at close range. Do take note not to touch them though, as the koalas can get stressed when they are near humans.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nBe sure to allocate a whole day to explore Phillip Island when travelling out of Melbourne, as there are many other exhibits and attractions to explore. Delve into the historic charm of \nChurchill Island\n as it is the site of the first European garden in Victoria and hosts heritage farming activities. And don\u2019t miss the opportunity to engage with interactive exhibits at the \n\u2018Antarctic Journey\u2019 Centre\n, where you will experience a journey that brings the beauty of Antarctica to life through futuristic displays.\n\n\n3. Enjoy quality food and wine at Yarra Valley while exploring the Dandenong Ranges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndulge your taste buds and explore over 80 cellar doors in Yarra Valley, one of the world's top wine regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocated relatively closer to Melbourne city, it takes just over an hour to drive to Yarra Valley. This is a great choice for those who love to savour culinary delights and \nfine wine\n. Yarra Valley is known as one of the world's premier wine growing regions, with over 80 cellar doors offering wine tastings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re travelling with friends, go for wine flights to sample the wide range of sparkling wines at the Chandon winery at Yarra Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndulge in a wide range of wines at the \nChandon\n winery by sampling their famous \nsparkling wines\n. Tip: get a flight of wine (a selection of wine varietals) and share it among friends for the opportunity to taste the different wines available. My personal favourite is the Chandon Sparkling Pinot Shiraz \u2013 you don\u2019t find sparkling reds available in the market often!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaste some of the famous wines from TarraWarra Estate \u2013 a 400ha property at Yarra Valley. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who prefer \nwhite wines\n and \nred wines\n without the bubbles, visit \nTarraWarra Estate\n at Yarra Valley, famous for their Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. They have two wine tasting options \u2013 a premium range at AU$30 (S$26) per person to sample six types of wines, or an estate wine (made only from grapes owned by the winery) tasting at AU$20 (S$17) per person, also for six types of wine. Costs are waived when you purchase wines from them after.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to the Kokoda track, a relatively easy hike within the Dandenong Ranges near Yarra Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who are also keen on pairing their trip with a good hike, visit the Dandenong Ranges to explore a set of low mountain ranges. The picturesque area is located near Yarra Valley, perfect for an invigorating hike after treating your taste buds to the exquisite wines.\u00a0\n\n\nGo on the 1,000 steps trail \u2013 a popular and scenic four-kilometre walking track with a steep, upward climb. This is also known as the Kokoda Memorial Walk, dedicated to honouring the lives of the soldiers who fought on the Kokoda Trail during World War II. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReward yourself with heavenly scones and whipped cream at Miss Marple\u2019s Tearoom in Sassafras, Melbourne - a must-stop attraction after your hike. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hiking, have some scones at the very popular \nMiss Marple\u2019s Tearoom\n served with their delicious whipped cream. It\u2019s only open on weekdays, from 11:00am to 4:00pm, so plan your visit accordingly, and reach early to avoid the long queues. I arrived at about 11:45am and had to wait about an hour. If you\u2019re not the type to stand in line, do reach there before 11:00am to avoid waiting for the scones.\n\n\n4. Get a nice tan and relax at Brighton Beach and St Kilda Beach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the charm of Melbourne's Brighton Bathing Boxes, a vibrant row of historic seafront sheds just 30 minutes from the CBD, now iconic structures along the picturesque Brighton Beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those who just want a short getaway from the city, check out the beaches near Melbourne central business district (CBD). The Brighton Bathing Boxes are located just 30 minutes by car from Melbourne CBD and consist of a long row of brightly coloured sheds that line the Brighton Beach. The boxes that were originally built in the 1860s as modest seafront changing rooms are now privately owned and are mostly used to store equipment like chairs, beach umbrellas and fishing equipment. They have evolved into iconic structures of Brighton Beach, where many tourists and families go to relax with their children!\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy the vibrant atmosphere of St Kilda Beach with a short day trip from Melbourne CBD, where you can relax, soak up the sun, and shop for locally crafted goods at the Sunday Esplanade Market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust six kilometres south of Melbourne CBD is St Kilda Beach, a popular spot during weekends for locals to relax, sunbathe, and play beach volleyball. If you\u2019re looking to purchase locally produced gifts, visit St Kilda Beach on Sundays for the \nSt Kilda Esplanade Market\n. Open every Sunday from 10:00am, this market sells a wide range of Australian products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed a reason to travel?

It's Asia's largest submarine monument that stealthily cruised the ocean depths on various missions during the 1960s.

These give a vivid sense of the vessel's storied past and the gripping adventures it once embarked upon.\n\n\nWhile you\u2019re here, take a stroll along the picturesque riverside of Kalimas located in the backdrop of this attraction.

Not sure what to eat in Surabaya? For a unique treat, try the Bubur Madura. This sweet treat is a harmonious blend of coconut milk, rice flour, and sago, simmered to perfection until it reaches a sumptuously thick consistency. Or, have a taste of authentic Madurese sweet porridge at Mbak Nur. Their menu features a variety of local snacks, from marrow porridge to pearl porridge, all generously drizzled with rich coconut milk sauce and a luscious helping of liquid brown sugar sauce on top.\u00a0\n\n\nBut Pasar Atom isn\u2019t just about tantalising your taste buds.

Early check-in allows travellers to drop off their baggage and receive their boarding passes ahead of their scheduled departure, starting from 3 to 24 hours before the flight. This service is particularly beneficial for those who want to explore the airport\u2019s amenities or simply avoid the last-minute rush. Unlike regular check-in, which opens about 2 to 3 hours before departure, early check-in provides more flexibility and reduces time spent in queues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan passengers complete the early check-in process online for all airlines operating out of Changi Airport, or are there exceptions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office. However, there are exceptions, and some smaller or charter airlines might not provide this service. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines directly for specific online check-in availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any specific requirements or documents needed to complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo complete online check-in for flights departing from Changi Airport, passengers will need their booking reference or ticket number and the passport details of all travellers. Some airlines may also require travellers to enter visa details or other travel documentation depending on their destination. It\u2019s important to have all necessary documents handy at the time of online check-in to ensure a smooth process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can passengers with special needs or requests, such as extra baggage or special assistance, manage these needs when checking in online?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen checking in online, passengers with special needs or additional requests can manage these preferences through the airline\u2019s website. Most airline interfaces offer options to add extra baggage, request assistance at the airport, or make other necessary arrangements. If specific needs aren\u2019t addressed on the online check-in platform, passengers should contact the airline directly to ensure all accommodations are in place before arriving at the airport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat steps should passengers follow if they encounter issues during the online check-in process?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf passengers encounter any difficulties during the online check-in process, it's important to address the issue promptly to ensure a smooth and stress-free journey. Here are the steps you should follow:\n\n\n\n\nCheck Your Internet Connection: Sometimes, issues can be as simple as a faulty internet connection. Ensure your device is connected to a stable internet service to avoid interruptions during the check-in process.\n\n\nVerify Your Details: Double-check the accuracy of all required information, such as your booking reference, ticket number, and passport details. Errors in these entries can prevent successful check-in.\n\n\nConsult the Airline's FAQ or Help Section: Most airline websites have a FAQ or help section where common issues with online check-in are addressed. This can be a quick way to solve your problem without needing to contact customer service.\n\n\nContact the Airline Directly: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, contact the airline's customer service for assistance. Have your booking details ready to facilitate a quick resolution. Airlines typically offer support via phone, email, or live chat.\n\n\nVisit the Jewel Early Check-In Lounge: If you encounter technical difficulties during the online check-in process and cannot resolve them through digital means, head over to the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge at Changi Airport to check in.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, passengers can effectively address issues encountered during online check-in, minimising delays and ensuring that their travel plans remain on track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor passengers using early check-in, where can they drop off their luggage at Changi Airport, and during what hours is this service available?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor passengers who opt for early check-in at the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge, luggage can be conveniently dropped off at the\u00a0counters located within the lounge itself.\n\n\n\nFor passengers with odd-sized baggage, passengers flying on airlines departing from Terminal 1 may check in their odd-sized baggage at Jewel Early Check-in Lounge\u00a0(except Scoot and Qatar Airways). For passengers flying on airlines departing from Terminals 2-4, please proceed to the check-in row at the main terminal for assistance.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, if passengers choose to check in online, they\u2019ll need to drop off their luggage at their airline\u2019s designated check-in row in the departures hall of the corresponding terminal at Changi Airport. The luggage drop-off service at both locations is typically available from 12 to 24 hours before the flight\u2019s departure, but hours may vary depending on the airline and terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing online check-in, what are the next steps passengers must take upon arriving at Changi Airport?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing online check-in, may proceed to drop off any checked baggage at the Jewel Early Check-in Lounge, or at the designated airline counters..

The landscape, the history, the people, the food, everything is gorgeous. It\u2019s one of the best places to travel to, period. And then there is Addis Ababa, the vibrant capital of Ethiopia, which means New Flower in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.\u00a0\n\n\nNot only is it filled with cultural attractions, but it\u2019s also located right between most of Ethiopia\u2019s natural attractions, like the Bale Mountains National Park. Tl;dr: Addis Ababa is the perfect launchpad for your Ethiopian wanderlust, offering an abundance of activities and experiences to indulge in. So, if you're yearning for a taste of travelling to Ethiopia and seeking incredible things to do in Addis Ababa, you're in for an unforgettable adventure.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nP.S And you can fly directly to Addis Ababa from Singapore via Ethiopian Airlines\u2019 four times weekly services! \n\n\n1. National Museum of Ethiopia\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you're passionate about Ethiopian history and culture, Addis Ababa is an absolute haven. History buffs will love Addis Ababa for the many, many museums around, among which the National Museum of Ethiopia is considered the most important in not just the country, but in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\nLocated in the city centre, the three main levels hold cultural objects and traditional Ethiopian artwork. These exhibits eloquently narrate the prestigious and rich history of Ethiopia, a country with the distinction of being one of the few in its continent that have never been colonised. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDown in the basement level is where you\u2019ll encounter the most renowned exhibition space that homes Lucy \u2014 the skeleton of the oldest human ancestor ever found. Would you believe she was named after a Beatles song? Equally exciting are also the remains of extinct animals, like the sabretooth tiger and the gigantic savannah pig.\u00a0\n\n\nEntrance fees are just 10 birr per person (S$0.25), and English-speaking guides are there to provide tours for a small tip. This remarkable showcase of Ethiopian heritage and prehistoric marvels is an experience not to be missed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 2QQ6+6P4, Addis Ababa Arada, Ethiopia\n\n\nOpening hours: \nTuesday to Sunday \u2014 9:00am to 5:00pm\n\n\n2. Mount Entoto\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAddis Ababa is also great for hiking, with its beautiful landscapes, especially at its high elevation (one of the highest capitals in the world). Not far from the city (just a quick 40min drive from city central) is Mount Entoto, the highest peak of the Entoto mountain range.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nApparently, it was from here that the second Emperor of Ethiopia saw the city of Addis Ababa and decided to crown it with the title of the capital. If you do make the climb, let us know if you feel the same.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s a great hike\u2014pretty relaxing with the winding, gentle trekking paths\u2014that takes only 2 \u00bdhr to reach the summit. You can also opt to take a taxi up the mountain in just 15 mins instead.\n\n\nAmidst the mesmerising mountain views and breathtaking scenery (the mountain is packed with eucalyptus trees, a koala\u2019s fever dream), you\u2019ll also pass by the Entoto Maryam church (an ancient church built in 1877) and the Entoto Maryam museum too.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat\u2019s special is not just the collection of religious and ceremonial items, but also the fact that the building itself resides within the emperor\u2019s former palace before he moved into the capital. An enchanting blend of nature, history, and culture awaits you on this Ethiopian highlands adventure \u2014 pretty sweet if you ask us. \n\n\n3. Addis Merkato\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe crowded, chaotic market of Merkato is also one of Addis Ababa\u2019s must-sees. It\u2019s supposedly the largest market in Africa, with over 7,000 businesses hawking their wares to casual tourists and serious traders alike.\n\n\nIt\u2019s nothing like your average market. There will be donkeys and porters ferrying various bags on their shoulders, and there will be herds of goats crossing the road.\u00a0\n\n\nHere you\u2019ll find pretty much everything: from fresh fruits to traditional Ethiopian coffee pots, and handwoven shawls to exotic spices. Shopping is just part of the fun. The real entertainment? Haggling. It\u2019s pretty much a game to see who can score the best deals around.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, this area is also infamous for the occasional pickpocket, so it\u2019s highly recommended to have a guide bring you around to navigate this fascinating and lively Ethiopian food and retail paradise safely.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Dubai tera building, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Open 24 hours, but closed on weekends.\n\n\n4. Meskel Square\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMeskel Square is, in essence, a town square, but where it gets its name from is the Meskel Festival, which is aptly held here every year. This religious event is renowned as one of the \nbest festivals to visit around the world\n, making Meskel Square a focal point for global festival enthusiasts.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nDepending on the time of year, visitors get to watch a variety of concerts, parades, car races, and sometimes political demonstrations or take part in seasonal festivals. For a comprehensive list of festivals, refer to this \nwebsite\n. It\u2019s a popular spot for people-watching too.\u00a0\n\n\nMeskel Square has also been compared to Shibuya Crossing for being one of the most chaotic intersections on Earth. The only difference is there aren\u2019t any traffic lights, there\u2019s no roundabout, and there are no traffic cops in sight.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 2Q66+3G5, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Monday to Friday \u2014 8:00am to 5:00pm, Saturday \u2014 8:00am to 12:00pm\n\n\n5. Wonchi\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNow, this is something you will not get to experience anywhere else. At the highest volcano in Ethiopia is where you\u2019ll find an incredibly crystal-clear crater lake in the middle of the caldera. Wonchi Crater Lake, as it\u2019s called, is where the community of Haro Wonchi (Wenchi Village) is based. It is a bit of a road trip to get there, involving a good 3hr drive, but its unspoilt, man-scarce scenery really makes up for the distance.\u00a0\n\n\nThe area was awarded the title of \u201cBest Tourist Village\u201d in 2021 by the World Tourism Organisation, and the reason is plain for all to see. Besides the crater lake itself, there is also the dense alpine vegetation\u2014which is home to numerous native creatures\u2014a waterfall at the foot of the hill, as well as several mineral springs that make up the landscape.\u00a0\n\n\nTo get to the base of the caldera where the lake is, you can either hike the 4km distance, passing through the gorgeous greenery, fields and traditional villages, or rent a mule for a relaxing and scenic ride down. Once there, you can have a picnic and enjoy the view, or go on a boat trip around the lake.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n QWV2+MC4, Shube, Ethiopia\n\n\n6. Bale Mountains Safari\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMost people would think of dry Savannah ala Lion King when they think of African wildlife, but Ethiopia\u2019s safari experiences are nothing like that. You\u2019ll find that kind of African safari experience further south in Kenya and Tanzania instead.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nRather than majestic giraffes and grand elephants, you\u2019re more likely to see native Ethiopian wolves\u2014the rarest canid in the world\u2014instead. They\u2019re found mostly north of Bale Mountains Safari, where the Sanetti Plateau is. Not only is it the most accessible safari from Addis Ababa (you can take a road trip that will last up to 8hrs, instead of a charter flight), but it also does not lose out at all in terms of wildlife density.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Harenna Forest, found in the south of the park, is where you\u2019ll find colobus monkeys, wild horses, and Menelik bushbuck, among other animals. Keep your eyes peeled, you might be lucky enough to spot lions, leopards and even spotted hyenas.\u00a0\n\n\nBale Mountains are best treated as a two to three-day side trip from Addis Ababa. There are plenty of accommodations available, whether as lodges or camps. Pick your type of rustic!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n VPPM+8PG, Rira, Ethiopia\n\n\n7. Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know about rock sculptures\u2014amazing works of art chiselled and polished from stone, but what if an entire building was carved out of a single stone? Up in Ethiopia\u2019s north, the mountain town of Lalibela is where you\u2019ll find eleven churches carved from volcanic rock.\u00a0\n\n\nThis ancient holy city was built in the 12th century, under the king\u2019s orders to create a new Jerusalem. It\u2019s still frequented by Christians today, especially during Christmas and Easter. You\u2019ll often find worshippers offering their prayers or reading religious texts here, but even those who are not of the faith are welcome to explore the amazing architecture.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to think how the interiors, with their semi-circular arches, doors and windows, as well as all the complex drainage systems, passages, tombs and catacombs, could be made out of one singular rock. Not only that, but there are also intricate human figure carvings and murals depicting scenes from the Bible on the ceilings and the walls.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the churches are still preserved in their natural setting, some parts have been seriously damaged due to weathering over the past few decades. As such, it is always best to see it as soon as possible. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 22MV+79C, Unnamed Road, Lalibela, Ethiopia\n\n\n8. Blue Nile Falls\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCome rain or shine, you\u2019ll always get to see a rainbow at the Blue Nile Falls. It\u2019s also called Tis Abay, which means The Great Smoke in Amharic, which is a fitting name for a 42m-high waterfall and its thunderous spray of mist.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThe waterfall is at its strongest during the months of August and September, but visitors have commented that it\u2019s worth visiting even during its off-season. Just be sure to prepare wisely, with the right \nbackpack\n to carry your essentials and clothes fit for adventure, and you're all set for an unforgettable waterfall escapade!\n\n\nIt\u2019s accessible from Bahir Dar, a town on the shores of Lake Tana that flows into the Blue Niles. Getting there requires visitors to hike a short 5km trail, which includes crossing a 17th-century suspension bridge, and it\u2019ll lead you to a breathtaking vantage point. Though the journey might sound daunting, it actually only takes roughly 3hrs to complete, with plenty of time in between to gawk at the scenery. \n\n\n9. TO.MO.CA Coffee\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIt\u2019d be a shame if we didn\u2019t mention Ethiopian \ncoffee\n in a piece about Ethiopia, so here\u2019s where coffee lovers can find the gold standard of Ethiopian coffee: TO.MO.CA Coffee.\u00a0\n\n\nThe coffee shop looks a little antique\u2014valid since it was established in 1953 and was the first coffee roasting company in Ethiopia to provide roasted and ground coffee to both international and local customers. There aren\u2019t any seats even, but you can always lean against one of the stand-up tables and gaze pensively onto the street with a mug in hand.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile you could order just a regular cup of americano or latte, you have got to try Ethiopia\u2019s most famous style of coffee, the caffe macchiato. Now, this has absolutely nothing to do with the caramel-laden milky sugar bomb from a certain global franchise. Instead, it\u2019s a lil cup of espresso served with a dollop of foamed milk on top and served hot. Trust us when we say it\u2019ll definitely wake you up, jetlagged or not.\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019d like, you can get coffee beans here too. They sell only Ethiopian Harrar Coffee Beans (a heady bean known for its wine and fruit-like flavour) at different levels of roast. Prices start at 270 Birr (S$6.80) for 250g.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Wawel St, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n 6:30am to 8:30pm\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs you gear up for your exciting journey to Addis Ababa from Singapore, remember to pack your sense of adventure and curiosity. \nExploring hidden overseas gems\n like this vibrant Ethiopian capital opens up a world of possibilities. On your travels, you'll discover endless things to do in Addis Ababa, from immersing yourself in its rich culture to tasting its unique cuisine. All that\u2019s left to do is prep a notebook of common Amharic phrases like \u2018konjo\u2019 or \u2018ameseginalehu\u2019 (locals love it when you speak their language), and you\u2019re pretty much set to go!\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTikTok\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right into your inbox.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Travel Information\nTravelling to Ethiopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight in the comfort of your own home.

Instead, it\u2019s recommended to take minibuses instead, or if you\u2019re planning to do some sightseeing, you could hire a taxi for a full day instead. \n\n\nCurrency\n\n\nThe official currency of Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips & Guides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthiopia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\nEnjoyed this article?

As the capital and biggest city in the United Kingdom (UK), London is undoubtedly an amazing place with rich history, world-class museums, great architecture and shopping available at every turn. To better enjoy every bit of what London has to offer during your next visit, we guarantee that you\u2019ll discover even more wonders when you travel out of central London on day trips.\u00a0\n\n\nHere are some of the best day trips from London to go on to best explore and experience the nearby cities. These recommendations are about two hours away from central London by train or car, allowing you to maximise your explorations of these historic towns.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1. Soak in Roman history and sights in Bath, UK\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTravel: 1h 30min train ride from London to Bath ~GBP25 (S$40.34)\n\n\nFounded by the Romans in the 1st century AD, the city of Bath is famous for its Roman and Georgian architecture that stands to date. Built of oolitic limestone from the mines under Combe Down, Bath is the largest city in the county of Somerset, England.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving developed into an elegant spa city that is now also famed for its literature and art, the Roman Baths located in the centre of the City of Bath is a must-visit spot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhilst in Bath, you have to make a trip down to the beautifully preserved Roman Baths when you are here! This magnificent temple and bathing complex houses natural spring water from the River Avon and was used by Romans to cleanse and purify themselves. However, you will not be able to take a dip in the Roman Baths during your visit as the water quality has deteriorated over time, making it unsuitable for anyone to enter the water. For the history geeks; the hoard of 17,500 Roman coins spanning the period 30 BC to 274 AD found in the foundations of the Gainsborough Bath Spa in 2007 is on permanent public display in an interactive exhibit right here at the Roman Baths.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you\u2019re planning a trip down, this famous destination among tourists and school groups can get very crowded, especially in the peak summer months. Pro-tip to beat the queue: make a trip down in the morning when they open or book your tickets in advance online. Be sure to check out their audio tours if you wish to listen to commentaries about the rich history of the Roman Baths.\u00a0\n\n\nBe sure to check the opening hours on \nThe Roman Baths website\n, as they differ with the seasons.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA beautiful 18th CE bridge built in the Palladian style, the Pulteney Bridge overlooking River Avon will instantly catch your eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnother one of the city\u2019s famous Georgian architectures not to be missed when you are in Bath would be the famous Pulteney Bridge. This bridge is named after Frances Pulteney, the wife of one of the largest landowners in Bath in the 18th century. This very bridge is also the one featured in Les Miserables \u2013 in Javert\u2019s suicide scene that sent him into the River Seine.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you are looking for a place to snap some aesthetic travel photos on your \nmobile phone\n or \ndigital camera\n for memories, this destination should be at the top of your list! Take some time to explore the area as well as the variety of restaurants, coffee shops and gift shops there.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2. Explore quaint Cambridge\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTravel: 50-80min train ride from London ~GBP20 (S$32.27)\n\n\nCambridge is a relatively small city northeast of London where one can take a relaxing day trip to explore the different sights. If you are looking for a place to take a break from the bustling city life, this compact place is perfect as it can be explored mostly on foot or on a bicycle.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlide up and down the River Cam in a punt so that you can take in the view of all the riverside colleges and sights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhilst strolling along River Cam, which runs through the heart of Cambridge, take in the greenery, sights and sounds of the city. Punting down the river is another unique experience not to be missed in Cambridge. Though it might seem like it, punting is not the same as canoeing or kayaking. Instead of a paddle, punting makes use of a long pole to drag your punt across the riverbed. Yes, it can be a great arm workout but it is also a fun experience to try out with your travel companions. Sail through the \u2018backs\u2019 of the famous Cambridge colleges, admire sublime bridges and even take a peek into private gardens.\n\n\nPro-tip\n: Booking online in advance is recommended as you can score significant discounts compared to on-the-day rates for shared or private tickets purchased at the departure point.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mediaeval buildings of Cambridge University is another spot to visit when you go on a day trip from London to Cambridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen you are in Cambridge, you certainly would want to pay a visit to Cambridge University, one of the top global universities in the world. Not only home to the brightest students, Cambridge University is also a popular filming location for some of the most popular movies, like Pirates of the Caribbean. On your day road trip to Cambridge University, do not forget to drop by Jack\u2019s Gelato for a sweet treat! Jack\u2019s Gelato is a fan favourite and well-known amongst all Cambridge students, being a great pick-me-up after a long day of lectures. There are new flavours every day but be sure to try out its staple honeycomb flavoured gelato. Enjoy the gelato from about GBP5 (S$8.07) for 2 scoops.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3. Visit the magical Oxford\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTravel: ~1h train ride from London ~GBP30 (S$48.41)\n\n\nHome to the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is another city west of central London filled with beautiful historic buildings that have starred in many films and television series.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover, marvel, and explore the most prestigious, and possibly the best school in the UK, the University of Oxford, on your day trip from London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVisit the most prestigious school in the UK, the University of Oxford, via a guided tour. Exploring the school grounds without a guide might leave you walking around in circles as the buildings can look similar for someone not familiar with the place. It might be a bit hard to identify and get around the architecture on the huge campus if you do decide to explore free and easy. As such, it is definitely recommended to follow a guide around to better understand the rich history behind the school and its buildings! It is indeed an amazing sight and a great place for photos in every corner.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrist Church Great Hall, also known as Hogwarts\u2019 dining hall, is another spot to visit in Oxford if you are a Harry Potter fan!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBesides the university, Oxford is also known for some iconic filming locations. Go on a trip down memory lane with a Harry Potter filming locations tour for GBP6 (S$9.68) where you will see Hogwart\u2019s dining hall, Hogwart\u2019s infirmary room, and other spots filmed right in Oxford itself! Explore these iconic locations on a guided or self-guided tour to breathe in the magic. Do note that certain locations like Duke Humfrey\u2019s Library can only be accessed via tour.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the ones that desire a good drink, sip on award-winning \nspirits\n at The Oxford Artisan Distillery. Take a deeper look into the fine processes of making these award-winning spirits including vodka, gin and Rye whiskey. To avoid disappointment, do remember to plan beforehand and make a booking before going down as there are limited time slots and availability for each tour.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4. Brighten up in Brighton\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFamous for its location where it overlooks the stunning seaside and the well-known Palace Pier, \nBrighton is a hot spot\n not just amongst tourists, but popular with celebrities as well. Actors and musicians such as Adele and Nick Cave have owned homes in Brighton and have spoken highly of this city. Brighton is about a 2hr drive away from London, perfect for a road trip out of London.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nStanding tall at 162m, capture the perfect view of Brighton from the British Airways i360 observation tower. Located on the seafront of Brighton, you can glide up 138m in this glass pod to enjoy a 360-degree view of both the city and the seaside. Apart from taking a jaw-dropping OOTD from up here, you can also enjoy Sussex\u2019s finest sparkling wine, Nyetimber, along with the view. For the more thrill-seeking individuals, sign yourselves up for the thrilling new Walk 360 sky walk experience where you can climb out of the attraction\u2019s glass viewing pod and onto the roof to take a good look at Brighton beach!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrighton Palace Pier which sits right at the edge of Brighton is full of places to grab something to eat and also features amusement arcades and fairground rides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor families and the younger ones, do stop by the theme park at the end of the Brighton Palace Pier. Intended as a replacement for the Chain Pier which collapsed in 1896 due to a storm, Brighton Palace Pier has been frequently visited as a theatre and entertainment venue. Revamped in 1986, it was designed to include an amusement park with fairground rides and roller coasters. Perfect for families, this is the place to visit if you are looking for somewhere to spend a whole afternoon out and keep your kids and yourselves entertained.\u00a0\n\n\nWristbands for rides are GBP30 (S$48.41) for those 1.2m or above in height or GBP18 (S$29.04) for those below 1.2m, with access to the soft play areas.\u00a0\n\n\nPro-tip\n: purchase tickets online to get the wristbands at a lower price.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5. Travel back in time at Canterbury \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTravel: ~1h 30min train ride from London ~GBP20 (S$32.27)\n\n\nAs one of the most popular tourist destinations in the UK for its rich cultural history, you need to visit Canterbury for its indescribable charm of centuries-old historic sites and structures. It is the place where thousands of pilgrims journeyed to during the Middle Ages to pray and seek help from the shrine of Thomas Becket \u2013 one of the most prominent figures of his time as he was the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nTo fully enjoy the history that Canterbury has to offer, you have to visit Canterbury Cathedral, England\u2019s most important cathedral and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The cathedral is one of the oldest and most famous Christian institutes in England. Despite being almost burnt down in 1174, it was rebuilt after that and even survived World War 2 bombings. Being a significant place in English history, this is also the very place where Thomas Becket was assassinated on 29 December 1170. Even without knowing the many stories behind this cathedral, it still stands as a majestic masterpiece of architecture that includes a Romanesque crypt and stunning mediaeval stained glass windows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nCanterbury also houses one of England\u2019s oldest parks, Westgate Gardens, a place to take an afternoon stroll or chat over tea. Located immediately beside the West Gate Towers at the west of High Street, the gardens are open from dawn till dusk daily. Look out for the 200-year-old Oriental Plane tree that is featured in the Queen\u2019s Green Canopy, a unique tree-planting celebrating her Platinum Jubilee in 2022. For those who are interested, chauffeured punting options are available down the Great Stour river.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese are just a few day trip options that you can explore if you are looking for an escape from the bustling city life in London. If you have time to spare on your trip, spend a few days at each of the different cities to really experience all that they have to offer. \nLondon is undoubtedly a popular destination\n amongst travellers, but there is a lot more to experience and see in the UK!\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow us on\u00a0\nFacebook\n,\u00a0\nInstagram\n,\u00a0\nTiktok\n,\u00a0\nTwitter\n,\u00a0\nTelegram\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nYouTube\n.\u00a0You can also sign up for a\u00a0\nChangi Account\n\u00a0and have the latest news and articles delivered right to your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Travel Information\nTravelling to London\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop before you fly!\n\n\nShop 30 days in advance and up to 12 hours before your flight at the comfort of your own home.

Ltd. (\u201cCAG\u201d).\n Therefore, we aim to design and develop products and services with high levels of security and reliability. Despite our best efforts, due to the complex and sophisticated nature of our products and services, vulnerabilities and errors may still be present. CAG\u2019s vulnerability disclosure program is part of our efforts to enhance its cybersecurity posture, especially as it relates to our products and services. This VDP describes CAG\u2019s vulnerability disclosure program and sets out \nCAG\u2019s\n approach to requesting and receiving reports related to potential vulnerabilities and errors in our products and services. This VDP also outlines the terms and conditions for responsible vulnerability reporting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProducts and services in this VDP refer to digital products and services provided by CAG through [\nhttps://www.changiairport.com\n and \nhttps://www.ishopchangi.com/\n].\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPlease note that CAG\u2019s vulnerability disclosure program does not authorise, permit or endorse the taking of any action which may contravene applicable laws and regulations such as the Computer Misuse Act 1993. For the avoidance of doubt, any attempt to exploit or test suspected vulnerabilities such as by gaining unauthorised access to any computer/data is strictly prohibited, and neither permitted nor encouraged.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo report a vulnerability, please click on the \u2018Submit a report\u2019 button at the bottom of this page. Please note that reporting any vulnerability or error (including supplying your personal data and contact information) is entirely voluntary. By submitting a report, you hereby consent for your personal data (including your name, email address) to be collected, used and/or disclosed by members of the CAG Group to assess the report that you have submitted and for the purposes set out in Changi Airport Group (Singapore) Pte.

In the case where SQL injection vulnerability exist, querying for the version of database would be sufficient to demonstrate the ability to read database. Enumerating the existing rights in context of the SQL server session is also allowed. In time-based SQL context, showing that the response time varies and correspond to the different values set in sleep function would suffice.

Its strategic location has made it a vital trading centre and transportation hub for timber, rubber, and paper.\n\n\nPresently, about 200,000 people live in Sibu, with a majority Chinese population originating from Fuzhou of southern China, alongside Malay, Melanau (indigenous Sarawakian), and Ibans (indigenous people of Borneo). It is the third largest town in East Malaysia, after Kuching and Miri.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nEven though Sibu has a relatively laid back and down-to-earth vibe, it hasn\u2019t been as prominent on the tourist radar. However,\u00a0 with new (and cheap) direct flights now available from Singapore and other Malaysian cities, the town is slowly transforming from a sleepy commercial settlement to an exciting destination to discover!.\n\n\nMost of Sibu\u2019s tourist attractions are scattered around the city centre and are easily accessible on foot. Check out this itinerary perfect for a weekend getaway that\u2019s less than 2 hours away by flight from Singapore, served by Scoot. Here goes!\n\n\nDay One\n\n\n7AM: Rise and shine at Sibu Central Market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your day at Sibu's largest indoor market, Sibu Central Market. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking a trip to the market is the fastest way to see how the locals live - and in Sibu, that would be to Pasar Sentral Sibu, or the Sibu Central Market as it is informally known. The wet and dry market, built in 1996, is one of the largest in Malaysia. There are over 1000 stalls situated within the two-storey building, and a food court on the upper level. \n\n\nThe market is located in the city centre, opposite the busy Express Boat Passenger Terminal. Over here, merchants are eager to show off their wide range of livestock, along with fresh goods and farm produce.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the vibrant and exotic offerings of a local market, from essential cooking ingredients to rare tropical fruits and unique handicrafts. Sibu is definitely one of the best holiday destinations to head to in Malaysia! Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitors will be able to find all the essential cooking ingredients they need to prepare some of the most authentic local delicacies back home. \n\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised to see exotic tropical fruits \u2013 like the terung asam (Iban eggplants; a type of orange-coloured eggplant shaped deceptively like tomatoes) \u2013 that you wouldn\u2019t be able to find elsewhere in Malaysia. There are also live chicken and ducks neatly wrapped in newspapers, and gorgeous handicraft made by locals that tourists can bring home as souvenirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure you get the freshest goods on your short weekend getaway, it's best to visit early in the day as they tend to sell out by afternoon. Weekends offer more stalls, but also means more visitors, so plan accordingly and wear comfortable shoes for the walking adventure ahead. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe prepared for some walking as the market is massive. The freshest goods usually sell out in the afternoon, so go as early as you can. More stalls are open on the weekends but that will also mean more visitors, so plan accordingly.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Jalan Channel, Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday to Sunday - 6:00am to 6:00pm\n\n\n9:30AM: A taste of local breakfast\n\n\n \nThe late celebrity chef and television personality, Anthony Bourdain, once described Sarawak laksa as the \u201cbreakfast of the gods\u201d. Simply put: it\u2019s a must-try dish when you land in Sibu. \n\n\nLaksa is made with rice vermicelli that is cooked in a rich and aromatic broth made from sambal belacan, tamarind, spices, and lemongrass. Unlike the laksa found in West Malaysia, Sarawak\u2019s laksa is known for its curry soup base. It\u2019s also served with lime and sambal chilli on the side. \n\n\nTalk to the locals and you will realise each Sarawakian has his personal favourite laksa. In Sibu, visitors will likely be directed to Aloha Corner if they\u2019d like to have one of the best Sarawak laksa for breakfast. \n\n\nThe late celebrity chef and television personality, Anthony Bourdain, once described Sarawak laksa as the \u201cbreakfast of the gods\u201d.

In Sibu, visitors will most like to be directed to Aloha Corner if they\u2019d like to have one of the best Sarawak laksa for breakfast.\n\n\nAloha Corner is a humble kopitiam tucked in the northwest of Sibu city centre. It\u2019s a beloved food place for the locals, with stalls selling fishball noodles, roti canai, char kway teow, and of course, Sarawak laksa.\n\n\nA bowl of regular Sarawak laksa here costs RM$5 (estimated S$1.53) and it\u2019s topped with a generous portion of shredded chicken and prawns. Diners may opt for the Supreme version priced at RM$10 (estimated S$3.06), which comes with extra rice vermicelli, topping, and soup.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Jalan Keranji, Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday to Sunday\u20136AM to 5PM\n\n\n11AM: Understand Sibu\u2019s history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the rich history and culture of Sibu at the Sibu Cultural Heritage Museum, established in 1988 and now located in the Sibu Heritage Centre. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sibu Cultural Heritage Museum was set up in 1988 by the Cultural Heritage Committee of Sibu Civic Centre with support provided by various ethnic associations. It was initially located on the ground floor of the Sibu Civic Centre before moving to its current location \u2013 inside the Sibu Heritage Centre \u2013 in 2010. The museum tells a vivid story of Sibu from its early days onwards. This is a great place to learn more about the rich history and culture of this riverine town.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIt traces the footsteps of the early settlers of Sibu during the formative years of Malaysia. It also showcases a series of old photographs and antiques of the ethnic groups from the central regions of Sarawak and the local Chinese Fuzhou community.\n\n\nOther highlights of the museum include the taxidermy of animals native to the region, like the orangutan, moon rat, and rhinoceros hornbill, along with skulls taken from Iban longhouses.\n\n\nThese were carefully preserved from a time when headhunting was commonly practised by the Dayak or the indigenous people living in Sarawak. At the moment, the Sibu Cultural Heritage Museum has no entrance fee.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n\u00a0182, Jalan Central, Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n\u00a0Tuesday to Sunday\u201310AM to 4.30PM\n\n\n1PM: Try the Legendary Sibu Kampua Mee (\u5e72\u76d8\u9762)\n\n\n \nBesides Sarawak laksa, Sarawakians are also proud of their kampua mee, a speciality that features tossed poached noodles in soy sauce and shallot oil.\n\n\nUnlike the renowned Sarawak kolo mee, the noodle used in kampua mee is straight. It\u2019s often served simply with a few slices of char siew or barbeque pork, spring onion, and chilli sauce. In Sibu, kampua mee is commonly served together with a bowl of flavourful spring onion soup or beef soup (beef kampua).\n\n\nAt Soon Hock Cafe & Restaurant, which has been selling this local favourite for the past two decades, most diners pair their kampua mee with a bowl of wanton (dumplings with minced pork fillings) served in dark soy sauce.\u00a0\n\n\nDon\u2019t be deceived by its simple looks, the Soon Hock kampua mee is tangy, fragrant, and tasty. Due to its popularity, you may find yourself in a long queue among the locals during peak dining hours. \n\n\nEach bowl of kampua mee costs between RM2.5 and RM4 (estimated S$0.76 - S$1.22) depending on the portion served. A bowl of wanton costs RM4 (estimated S$1.22).\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 55-59, Jalan Pedada, Taman Seduan 8, 96000, Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday, Wednesday to Sunday\u20136.30AM to 6PM\n\n\n3:30PM: Tua Pek Kong Temple and Goddess of Mercy Pagoda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep back in time and discover the oldest and most well-preserved Chinese temple in Sibu, the Eng Ann Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eng Ann Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple has a history that traces back as far as 1871. It\u2019s the oldest and most well-preserved Chinese temple in Sibu. Most of the materials used to build the temple, including the Tua Pek Kong statue, were imported directly from China. \nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nLord Tua Pek Kong is a deity of the Peranakan folk religion,worshipped by ethnic Chinese in Malaysia, Singapore, and parts of Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitors can enjoy a great view of the Rajang River at the temple. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eng Ann Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple was rebuilt from its original wooden structure into a Taoist building with tiled roof and stone flooring in 1890.\n\n\nTo the locals, the temple is not only a sacred place, it\u2019s also a place filled with miracles. The temple was left undamaged in a fire in 1928 which blazed through a large part of the town. Likewise, the temple remained unharmed in the continuous bombings launched by the Japanese and allied forces during World War Two.\n\n\nYou may wish to offer your respect to the deity, or take your time to admire the architecture and many stone sculptures found within the temple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Goddess of Mercy Pagoda in Sibu, Sarawak. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe adjacent Goddess of Mercy Pagoda was constructed in 1987. The seven-storey high pagoda is believed to be the most proportioned pagoda outside of China. \n\n\nClimb up to the top of the pagoda to enjoy a scenic view of the Rajang River. You can also have a look at the historic photos and paintings displayed on level three to learn more about the temple\u2019s illustrious past.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Jalan Temple, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday to Sunday\u2013Opens 24 hours\n\n\n5PM: Sunset at Rejang Esplanade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother relaxing thing to do in Sibu is to take a stroll along the picturesque Rejang Esplanade, located just a stone's throw away from the Eng Ann Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rejang Esplanade is a stone\u2019s throw away from the Eng Ann Teng Tua Pek Kong Temple. It\u2019s a picturesque waterfront promenade that stretches along Sungai Rajang or the Rajang River. The Esplanade was built in 1987 from land reclaimed by the river bed.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nToday, the Esplanade is a great place for evening strolls, photo-taking, and dining at one of the many alfresco restaurants there. It often hosts cultural performances, public events and celebrations. \n\n\nNonetheless, you will still be able to catch a glimpse of its past, including the wharf that used to be the earliest trading point in Sibu, and\u201cfloating markets\u201d or small boats carrying goods to be sold to the locals.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe most iconic of all will be the Swan Statue, erected by the Sibu Municipal Council in the 1990s. According to an old Sibu legend, the locals continued to feed the swans that were living in the region despite famine.\n\n\nIn return, the swan showed the locals how to extract edible starch from tropical palms. This edible starch is the sago we know in modern times \u2013 like the sago seeds added in various kinds of desserts. \n\n\nThis age-old friendship is how Sibu\u2019s nickname - Swan City - came about. It\u2019s common to see swan statues in various parts of Sibu, with the one by the Esplanade being the most famous.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 31, Jalan Maju, Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday to Sunday\u2013Opens 24 hours\u00a0\n\n\nEvening till late: Experience Sibu\u2019s nightlife at Sibu Night Market\n\n\n \nThe night market is an ensemble of local delicacies, fashion items, toys, and even household goods. On some nights, you might find more than 100 stalls gathered at the junction of Jalan Market or Market Street in the centre of Sibu.\n\n\nStart your local street food adventure right here at the night market as you\u2019ll get to savour some of the most authentic local snacks, like Foochow Siew Muai, Sarawak Satay, and Pulut Panggang (glutinous rice cooked inside banana leaf)).\n\n\nWhile you\u2019re savouring these local food, soak in the sounds and bustling Southeast Asian nightlife as well.\u00a0\n\n\n \nSome of the must-tries here include apam balik, or what the locals would call half-moon pancake, \u00a0a folded crepe with butter, sugar and peanut filling. The other is kompia, Sibu\u2019s most famous crusty baked buns. Traditional kompia sold in Sibu is made from wheat flour, water, salt and topped with sesame seeds. It\u2019s baked in a charcoal-filled clay oven that gives it a unique fragrance.\u00a0Kompia was brought in from Fuzhou, southern China by the Chinese community who settled in Sibu. It can be eaten as it is or served with a generous stuffing of minced pork.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nAddress:\n Jalan Market, Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Monday to Sunday\u20135PM to 10PM\n\n\nDay Two\n\n\n8AM: An iconic Sibu dish for breakfast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDing bian hu is made by pouring rice flour mixture to the side of a hot wok. Image credit: Image: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDing bian hu is yet another iconic dish in Sibu that was brought in by the Chinese Fuzhou immigrants. It literally means \u201cwok edge paste\u201d because it\u2019s made from pouring rice flour batter to the side of a hot wok, till it forms a sheet of thin noodle. The noodle will then be scraped off the side into the wok, where simmering stock welcomes it.\u00a0\n\n\nDing bian hu is usually served with other ingredients including black fungus, shredded pork, cuttlefish, and fish balls. The locals see the soupy dish as a kind of comfort food, best eaten in the morning to warm their stomachs and fuel them with the energy needed for the day.\n\n\nFor the most traditional version, head to Chop Hing Huong, an eatery that has been in business since 1959. The locals believe this is where you can get the most nostalgic taste of the dish that is freshly made every day. A bowl of ding bian hu costs RM5 (estimated S$1.53).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDing bian hu is the go-to breakfast for many Sibu locals.

It is named after Sungai Merah, or the red river.The Pasar was where the pioneer batch of 72 Chinese immigrants landed on 12 January 1901. They were led by Wong Nai Siong, a revolutionary leader and educator, who originated from Fuzhou in southern China.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nWong later led a second batch of Chinese immigrants to Sibu on 5 March 1901. He also helped manage the welfare of the immigrants as they settled down in the town. As a result, this area is historically significant to the local Chinese community.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWong Nai Siong garden along the Sungai Merah heritage walk. Image credit: Image: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the area has been restored into a quaint walking trail by the riverfront and the Pasar is still in operation providing daily goods and services to those living nearby. While you\u2019re there, visit the Pasar, admire the views along the river, and visit the Wong Nai Siong memorial garden which commemorates Chinese pioneers in Sibu.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Monday to Sunday\u2013Opens 24 hours\n\n\n10:30AM: World Fuzhou Heritage Gallery\n\n\nIf the Sungai Merah Heritage Walk tells us when the pioneering batches of the Chinese Fuzhou community came to settle in Sibu,the World Fuzhou Heritage Gallery is where we can learn more about their lives and legacy.\n\n\nLocated at Jalan Salim, the Gallery houses over 650 artefacts that were donated by the local Fuzhou families. Many with history tracing back to the first group of southern Chinese immigrants who arrived in 1901. Right now, the Gallery is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. \n\n\nThe Gallery is divided into five sections which showcase the traditions, culture, notable figures, livelihood, and the present generation of Fuzhou Chinese in Sibu. This is a must-visit spot for those who are interested in the history of overseas Chinese and their descendants. The Gallery has no entrance fee.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 5A, Lorong Salim 18D, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Monday to Saturday - 8:00am to 12:00pm, 1:30pm to 4:30pm\n\n\n12 NOON: Shop at one of the tallest buildings in Sibu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 125m-tall, Wisma Sanyan is a landmark building in Sibu, Sarawak. It houses the headquarters of the largest timber company in Sarawak, a shopping mall, government agencies, and serves as the venue for the annual Sibu BASE jump and Tower Run events. Image credit: Sarawak Trade and Tourism Office Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding at 125 metres tall, the Wisma Sanyan is a pinnacle landmark of Sibu. It used to be the tallest building in Sarawak until it was surpassed by Naim the Peak Condominium in 2019.\n\n\nWisma Sanyan is the headquarters of the Sanyan Group, which is the largest timber company in Sarawak. Apart from offices, the building also houses a shopping mall, a department store, and government agencies.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThis is also the venue for the annual Sibu BASE jump in September, and the Sibu Tower Run in March. At the Sibu BASE jump, participants will get to jump from the highest point of the Sanyan building and descend slowly to the ground using a parachute. The Sibu Tower Run requires participants to run up the 627-step staircase of Wisma Sanyan in the shortest possible time.\n\n\nFor others, Wisma Sanyan is a shopping haven. The shopping mall occupies five levels of the building, over 14,000m2 of retail space, and a Parkson Department Store. Visitors will surely be spoiled by the shopping and F&B choices.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \nNo. 1, Jalan Sanyan, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia \n\n\nOpening hours: \nMonday to Sunday\u20139AM to 10PM\n\n\n1PM: A taste of the Sibu indigenous food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMak Borneo was founded by Lau Qooway, a Sibu-based architect and photographer, who was inspired to learn more about the town's aboriginal past and indigenous food culture after a Singaporean friend inquired about trying Sibu native cuisine. Image credit: Mak Borneo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMak Borneo\u2019s founder, Lau Qooway is an avid traveller, architect, and photographer. He became curious about indigenous food after a Singaporean friend asked where they could try Sibu native cuisine.\u00a0\n\n\nThat was when Qooway realised, despite being a born and bred Sibu Chinese, he had never taken an effort to find out more about the aboriginal past of the town. The curiosity subsequently turned into the motivation to set up Mak Borneo.\u00a0\n\n\nThe food culture of the indigenous people is basic and natural. Most of the time, food is served raw or they are marinated and cooked in bamboo tubes. They respect nature and will only take fresh ingredients from the forest or the sea.\u00a0\n\n\n \nThat\u2019s why Qooway named his restaurant \u201cMak\u201d. In the indigenous Sarawakian language, Mak is the short form for Makai, which means food. It also means Mother Earth. Qooway thought the term fits into the way of living and cooking techniques of the indigenous people.\u00a0\n\n\nOver here, don\u2019t be surprised to see durian flowers, Midin (a kind of forest ferns) and even sagu worms on the menu. All of which are made by Mak Borneo\u2019s indigenous chef Helen and her husband Usin.\n\n\nPrices of dishes range between RM7 (estimated S$2.15) and RM25 (estimated S$7.69).\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Lot 1852, S/L 42, No.21, TGKT Bawah, LRG Dr Wong Soon Kai 4-D, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n\u00a0Opens daily from 10:00am to 11:00pm\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n3PM: Breathe in nature at the Bukit Lima Nature Reserve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother fun thing to do in Sibu, explore the lush urban park of Bukit Lima with its jungle trails and diverse wildlife, including long-tailed macaques and pangolins. Image credit: Sarawak Tourism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBukit Lima is an urban park; the \u201cgreen lung\u201d of Sibu that was opened in 2001. It is most popular for its jungle trails that bypass the largest peat swamp forest park in Sarawak, along with its close proximity to nature and wildlife.\u00a0\n\n\nThe entire trekking trail, which is on a well-paved wooden boardwalk, is about 5.7km long. The nature reserve is home to close to 40 species of flora and fauna and eight species of mammals. Visitors may spot long tailed macaques, squirrels, tropical birds, and even pangolins.\n\n\n \nPublic transport is available between Sibu town centre to Bukit Lima Nature Reserve. Take Bus No. 10 operated by the Lanang Transport Company at the Bus Terminal to arrive at the entrance of the nature reserve. A one-way ticket costs RM5 (estimated S$1.53). The journey takes about 20 minutes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening hours:\n Monday to Sunday\u20137AM to 10AM; 2PM-6PM\n\n\nEvening till late: A drink in a quiet town\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bars and karaoke lounges are bustling with locals and visitors alike who come to relax and unwind for a night out in Sibu, making it one of the best holiday destinations from Singapore to Malaysia. Image credit: Info Sibu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a glance, Sibu may appear like a quiet and ordinary town. In reality, it is dynamic and lively. \nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nIts vibrancy can be felt the most at night as bars and karaoke lounges are filled with young and old alike, who wish to unwind and end the day in a cosy and relaxing atmosphere.\n\n\nThere are several spots like Night 7 Bistro and Lot 10 Cafe, that visitors can go to if they fancy a drink with their friends and families. Oxygen Bar located at the Sibu Heritage Centre is one of them.\n\n\nOxygen began in 2016 when the owner longed for a venue to meet his business associates and friends for a beer and snack on weekends. He named the bar Oxygen because he wants it to be \u201cfresh, clean, drug-free, like oxygen that comes in when you sit alfresco\u201d.\n\n\nOxygen serves imported wine, beer and snacks from Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. It also has a variety of cocktails, non-alcoholic drinks, and a menu that\u2019s family-friendly.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 21, Jalan Wong Nai Siong, Pekan Sibu, 96000 Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday to Thursday and Sunday - 3:00pm to 1:00am, Friday and Saturday - 3:00pm to 2:00am\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSibu is a multicultural town that seamlessly blends its old and the new.

It is a rare destination that somehow manages to retain its relaxed charm, while still being exciting and urban.\n\n\nBut the allures of this Pearl of the Orient go beyond its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the \nmouth-watering delights of Penang street food\n, though we can\u2019t blame you for making these your main reasons to visit; the Penang Char Kueh Tiau is worth the trip alone.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nWith lush verdant pockets of nature just a short distance away from downtown George Town, it\u2019s not hard to want to get out and explore the greener spots in Penang. From hiking the crowning jewel of Penang Hill to exploring the tranquil sights of Balik Pulau on a bicycle, here are our top choices of nature-focused places to visit in Penang.\n\n\n1. Break a sweat hiking Penang Hill\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you\u2019ve checked all of the \nhiking trails in Johor Bahru\n off your to-do list, then trekking up Penang Hill should be your next adventure!\n\n\nKnown locally as Bukit Bendera, which means Flagstaff Hill, Penang Hill lives up to its namesake with how it looms 833 metres above sea level. It offers phenomenal views of George Town and the coastline, making it a must-visit for anyone coming into Penang for the first (or however many) time.\u00a0\n\n\nA hike on Penang Hill is a perfect way to get up close and personal with the local flora and fauna of Penang without having to travel too far out from George Town itself.\n\n\nThere are several hiking trails that weave and interconnect with each other. Each one offers a challenge of its own, different durations to complete, and different starting points. No matter whether you are a seasoned hiker or novice trekker, there\u2019s a trail on Penang Hill for you.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Habitat Penang Hill is a key attraction here. At the heart of this ecological haven lies the Curtis Crest Treetop Walk, an enchanting experience that allows visitors to wander along an elevated walkway amidst the lush tropical rainforest canopy. It is, after all, the highest accessible viewing platform on Penang Island, giving you unbeatable views of Penang Island, George Town, and even the Penang Bridge. Then, conquer the Langur Way Canopy Walk, a 230m suspension bridge 40m above ground, offering a thrilling adventure to those who're not afraid of heights. Admission is RM60 (S$17.20) for a standard entrance pass.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \nPenang Hill, Bukit Bendera, 11300 Bukit Bendera, Penang\n\n\nOpening Hours: \nMost locals recommend starting your hike as early as 6:00am, though hiking trails are open at all hours.\n\n\nCost:\n Free to visit, but if you\u2019re buying tickets for the funicular train there will be an admission rates tier. Get more information about the train schedules and pricing \nhere\n.\n\n\n2. Walk through a fairytale at Entopia by Penang Butterfly Farm\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEntopia by Penang Butterfly Farm is a sanctuary that beckons nature enthusiasts and curious travellers to embark on a journey through the enchanting world of insects and butterflies. There\u2019s just something magical about the way the free-flying butterflies of every colour and almost every species under the sun are allowed to just flit around uninhibited.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nWith its thoughtfully designed habitats, visitors can witness the life cycles of various butterfly species, explore lush gardens teeming with exotic plants, and even get up close and personal with a multitude of fascinating insects. Keep your eyes peeled as you\u2019re walking through the nature park because you may actually get lucky enough to witness the \u2018birth\u2019 of a butterfly right before your eyes!\n\n\nIt is also one of the best places to visit in Penang with family, with plenty of things to do for all ages. There are free talks and hands-on activities lined up daily so do check out the schedule and plan your visit accordingly. You and your little ones can go on a guided tour, see newly-emerged butterflies being released, or come up close with bugs.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter all the fun, dine at the Tapestree restaurant. Choose an outdoor seat so that you can enjoy a meal among nature! There\u2019s a great selection of sandwiches, pastas, Western and Asian main courses and a kids' menu too.\u00a0\n\n\nEntopia by Penang Butterfly Farm is around 45 minutes away from George Town via car, making it an excellent addition to any half- or full-day itinerary around Pulau Pinang.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 830, Jalan Teluk Bahang, Teluk Bahang, 11050 Tanjung Bungah, Pulau Pinang\n\n\nOpening Hours: \n9:00am to 6:00pm with last admissions at 5:00pm; Closed on Wednesdays\n\n\nCost:\n Ticket prices start from RM59 (S$17) with different admission rates and packages available. Find out more and purchase your tickets \nhere\n.\n\n\n3. Spice up your life with the Tropical Spice Garden\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThis is probably one of the most underrated places to visit in Penang. The Tropical Spice Garden is Penang\u2019s hidden paradise dedicated to showcasing a rich variety of spices from around the world.\n\n\nDesigned to be not only picturesque but educational as well. It\u2019s got themed terraces and gardens, as well as a Spice Museum on its sprawling 8-acre property. Perfect for the gardener in you or any traveller keen on discovering the region's culinary heritage, this botanical gem showcases over 500 tropical plant species, including a diverse array of aromatic herbs and spices commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe garden provides guided tours and cooking classes that allow visitors to gain insights into spice cultivation and the flavours integral to Malaysian cuisine.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nTake time to stop and smell the spices and pick up skills on identifying medicinal plants and how to use them in your everyday lives best.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDon\u2019t miss the outdoor cafe here that overlooks the Straits of Malacca. Besides park visitors, the Flora Cafe is a popular spot among families and cyclists.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n 2, Jalan Teluk Bahang, Kampung Keling, 11050 Tanjung Bungah, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Monday, Tuesday, Thursday \u2014 9:00am to 4:00pm; Friday to Saturday \u2014 9:00am to 6:00pm; Closed on Wednesdays\n\n\nCost:\n Admission tickets with free audio guides start from RM15 (S$4) for Children, RM28 (S$8) for Adults and RM20 (S$6) for Senior Citizens. Guided tours are also available. For more ticketing information, you can click \nhere\n.\n\n\n4. Roam in peace around Pulau Aman\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGet ready to get on the road less travelled on an easy day or half-day trip to Pulau Aman, a small island community just off the shore of mainland Penang.\u00a0\n\n\nHome to a community of fewer than 500 people, Pulau Aman, or Island of Peace, is an interesting time capsule of how a coastal Malay culture lives and operates in tandem with the times. Folks here are laid back and you will notice how easy it is to relax into the island\u2019s idyllic vibes.\n\n\nVisitors can explore the island's picturesque fishing villages, where time seems to have stood still, and experience the traditional Malay way of life. While nature lovers can indulge in the island's lush greenery - go for a hike, head to the beach or cycle around the island.\u00a0\n\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to savour fresh seafood at local eateries. Pulau Aman is particularly famous for its mee udang, which is a prawn noodle dish. The prawns are often cooked in a thick, flavourful broth, served with noodles, creating a hearty and satisfying meal. There\u2019s also a dry version called mee goreng udang.\u00a0\n\n\nGetting to Pulau Aman is half the challenge. There\u2019s no public transport to the Batu Musang Jetty on mainland Penang to catch your ferry to Pulau Aman itself, so you\u2019ll need your own transport there.\n\n\nThough if you\u2019re lucky, there\u2019s a reward waiting at the end of the drive. Come at the right time of day and you might just be in time to watch the local fishermen trawl the pristine waters for their catch of the day that could be on your dinner plate.\n\n\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nAddress:\n Pulau Aman, 14100, Simpang Ampat, Pulau Pinang\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Opened at all hours to visit, though the first and last boats to Pulau Aman are between 8:00am and 6:00pm. Remember to check the boat schedules.\n\n\nCost:\n Return tickets for the ferry are RM8 (S$3) for adults and RM4 (S$1.50)\u00a0 for children.\n\n\n5. Be boujee at Boulder Valley Glamping\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor those looking to experience being out in the great outdoors without sacrificing an ounce of comfort, we got you covered. Introducing Boulder Valley Glamping at Teluk Bahang just outside Penang National Park \u2013 an outside-of-the-box glamping paradise nestled amongst naturally formed boulders.\n\n\nVisitors can opt to stay in one of their on-site tents, but day-trippers can still come to dine at the restaurant and enjoy the lush jungle ambience of the area. Boulder Valley Glamping is only about 20 minutes away from the popular Batu Ferringi beach resort via car ride, so you can enjoy the best of both worlds!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWith 25 pre-pitched tents on the glamping site that are spread out with enough space in between for privacy and peace, their tents give the vibe of a very Robinson Crusoe-esque sleeping situation.\n\n\nThis is the perfect compromise for folks who want to have a tropical jungle experience, but their partners or companions are loath to give up any modern-day convenience. Enjoy the tranquillity of nature over lunch, and then head back to Batu Ferringi in the afternoon for water sports \u2013 it\u2019ll be a win-win for everyone!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress: \n8 Jalan Teluk Bahang, 11050 Teluk Bahang, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia\n\n\nOpening Hours: \nBusiness hours for the restaurant are between 7:00am to 6:30pm\n\n\nCost:\n Accommodation prices start from RM500 (S$145) per night. Get more information \nhere\n.\n\n\n6. Get lost at Penang National Park\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLocated just an hour out from George Town is the smallest national park in Malaysia, the Penang National Park.\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nUpon arrival, it might be tempting to take the locals up on their offer to bring you around to the different beaches on the island on their boats, but resist that urge. Instead, take the time to explore Penang National Park on your own. There is plenty of trekking you can get up to on its 1,213 hectares of land and sea that attracts scientists, researchers, and of course, nature enthusiasts to explore and learn from.\n\n\nLace up your trekking shoes, load up your \ntravel backpack\n, and fill up your \nwater bottle\n, because hiking is a popular activity here. Several well-marked trails, including the Canopy Walkway, lead you through the treetops for stunning views. Visitors can also explore the rich biodiversity of native species of fauna, from vibrant birds to elusive sea turtles, and even witness the phenomenon of bioluminescent plankton along certain beaches at night.\u00a0\n\n\nFor those seeking relaxation, the park's beaches, such as Teluk Duyung (Monkey Beach) and Pantai Kerachut, provide a tranquil escape. But if you want to up the ante, you\u2019ll be less than 20 minutes away from Batu Ferringi\u2019s beach resorts by car, and less than 10 minutes away from the heart-pounding ESCAPE Penang amusement and water park!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Pejabat Taman Negara Pulau Pinang, Jalan Hassan Abbas, 11050 George Town, Penang\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n 8:00am to 5:00pm\n\n\nCost:\n Free to visit, but you should prepare some cash for the admission tickets for the Canopy Walkway if you\u2019re planning on checking that out.\n\n\n7. Explore Balik Pulau on a bicycle\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRounding this list out is a destination and activity in Penang that we can\u2019t gatekeep even if we wanted to.\n\n\nGoing to Balik Pulau, meaning \u2018back of the island\u2019, feels like you\u2019re stepping into a moment in time when the pace of life is slower and things are much easier. It\u2019s located at the southwest of Penang island, and one of the best ways to explore this sleepy slice of verdant heaven is on a bicycle. The town is surrounded by picturesque countryside and rolling hills. Take a leisurely bike ride through the scenic landscapes, enjoying the fresh air and captivating views.\n\n\nBalik Pulau is renowned for its lush fruit orchards, and a visit here is incomplete without indulging in seasonal tropical fruits like durian, rambutan, and mangosteen. You can even take guided tours of the orchards to learn more about the cultivation of these delicious fruits.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKids will love the Audi Dream Farm, an eco-friendly farm that combines sustainable agriculture, interactive animal encounters, and fun outdoor activities. The petting zoo is a highlight, where you\u2019ll get to meet furry friends like rabbits and guinea pigs. You can even do camel riding!\u00a0\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nThere\u2019s also Countryside Stables Penang that offers horse feeding and joy rides, riding lessons, and photoshoots with horses for a keepsake you can bring home. For a dose of adorable goats, visit the Saanen Dairy Goat Farm to feed and interact with the playful goats and learn about goat farming. In short, families will find no lack of activities to entertain the little ones.\u00a0\n\n\nBefore the day ends, find a spot to view the sunset - they\u2019re known to look the absolute best when viewed from Balik Pulau. Time your visit to coincide with one and don\u2019t forget to enjoy the golden hour when it\u2019s out in full splendour!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat you need to know is that you can\u2019t visit the whole of Balik Pulau in one day. Plan for a morning or an afternoon to explore one specific area, then save the rest for another day.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAddress:\n Balik Pulau, Pulau Pinang\n\n\nOpening Hours:\n Opened at all hours\n\n\nCost:\n Free to visit, though we would recommend taking along enough cash for what you may need as ATMs are scarce in the area.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnd here are all the best attractions for nature lovers in Penang. No matter your preferred level of engagement with nature, you can find an experience for you here.\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to get around the island to the destinations we\u2019ve mentioned above just by using the local buses. You can also rent a car or a motorcycle to tailor your Penang adventure to your own pace and convenience, along with using rideshare apps like Grab to call for a car.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next time you\u2019re wondering what to do in Penang, you\u2019ll have way more options than just enjoying the sights in George Town. Whether you're exploring its historic lanes, savouring its world-renowned street food, or simply basking in its coastal charm, the sky is your oyster when you\u2019re in Penang.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor more updates on Changi Airport, follow us on \nFacebook\n, \nInstagram\n, \nTikTok\n, \nTwitter\n, \nTelegram\n and \nYouTube\n.
